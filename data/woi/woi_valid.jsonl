Travel and pack-rod versions of some of these rod types are also available for the angler on the go. Rods can be made in one-piece configurations which give the greatest strength and sensitivity, or in multiple pieces for ease of travel and storage. Many fishing rods over five feet in length are available in two to six piece models. Modern materials used for ferrules allow fishing rods with multiple sections to be nearly as strong and as sensitive as one-piece rods.

For a full-court game, basketball is played by two teams of five players each. While it s also common to play half-court ball with teams of three, however many people you ve got playing, it s important to have an even number of players on each team. Alternate basketball games for uneven numbers are included in the last section. Score points by shooting the ball through the hoop. In basketball, an offensive player can score between one and three points with a shot, depending on where the shot is taken on the floor.[2] Move the ball by dribbling or passing. When you have the ball, you have to either be stationary, with one foot planted on the floor to pivot from, or you have to be dribbling the ball, bouncing it up and down on the floor. When you re planted, you can pivot around on one foot, but that foot has to remain planted if you re not dribbling. You can still jump to shoot or pass, but when you come back down you need to have gotten rid of the ball. When you start dribbling, you must dribble constantly as you move, until you pass, shoot, or stop dribbling to plant on your pivot foot. If you stop dribbling, you cannot re-start dribbling, which is a foul called a  double-dribble.  It s also important to avoid  over/under  dribbles, or  carries , in which you pick up the ball from underneath and turn it over to dribble it down. Learn to dribble properly in the following section.", "Response": "Well basically there are two teams (normally 5 a side) and you need to get the ball and shoot it through the hoop.

{"Context": "My favorite food is jello. with fruit chunks", "Knowledge": "How can one possibly mold Jell-O into so many different shapes? The gelatin in Jell-O is what allows you to get so creative -- but what exactly is gelatin, anyway? Gelatin is just a processed version of a structural protein called collagen that is found in many animals, including humans. Collagen makes up almost one-third of all the protein in the human body. Collagen is a fibrous protein that strengthens the body s connective tissues and allows them to be elastic â€“ that is, to stretch without breaking. As you get older, your body makes less collagen, and individual collagen fibers become increasingly cross-linked with each other. You might experience this as stiff joints from less flexible tendons, or wrinkles due to loss of skin elasticity.", "Response": "Gelatin is made from collagen, a protein found in skin, bones and connective tissue?"}

You ask a guy who knows his way around the off-the-radar trails.

You only drive for about three miles before you run into the parking lot for Rattlesnake Lake and Rattlesnake Ledge trail. If the parking lots are full, you may need to park on the side of the road. One thing you won’t need for this hike is a Washington State Parks Discover Pass (since it’s not a state park). From the parking lot, the Rattlesnake Ledge trailhead is a .3 mile walk (just follow the signs around Rattlesnake Lake). The actual hike is just 1.9 miles each way. The trail is uphill the entire time, but don’t let this intimidate you. It’s an easy-to-medium uphill hike. The elevation rise isn’t too dramatic and it’s fairly steady the entire time. I saw plenty of kiddos heading up and down the hill having no problems, so I’d venture to guess even non-hikers are able to handle this trail. It took us less than 50 minutes to get to the top of Rattlesnake Ledge from the parking lot.

EOS My favorite album is Toxicity.  I think song by song its their strongest album.", "Knowledge": "System of a Down s 1998 debut was initially overlooked by the mainstream hard rock audience, as well as the specialized press. But heavy metal cognoscenti in both camps quickly realized that in their hands was a potentially crucial stepping stone for the future development of heavy metal. Sure enough, so challenging and groundbreaking were its contents that the album soared over most everyone s unsuspecting heads, its eventual gold sales status only achieved via Columbia Records  massive promotional muscle and nearly three years of intensive touring on the band s part. Consequently, early believers were pleasantly surprised when 2001 s long awaited follow-up, Toxicity met with instant popular acceptance, skyrocketing up the charts toward multi-platinum success. Yet, for the most part, it also managed to retained SOAD s unorthodox signature sound: so-called  nu-metal  uniquely infused with remarkable originality, including angular riffs, jagged rhythms, and oblique lyrics splattered all over the place. Like its predecessor, Toxicity seems utterly chaotic upon first listen, but things quickly begin falling into place, thanks to a number of small refinements, not least of which is a more generous melody, obviously pre-meditated, but rarely overdone. In turn, this immediacy greatly improved the album s chances at radio -- case in point, first single  Chop Suey!,  a track so potent not even September 11, nor mainstream radio s ensuing self-imposed, politically correct attempt at self-censorship, could tear from the airwaves (despite its none-too-discreet lyrics about suicide), the song s surprising success was reminiscent of another left-field hit from a decade earlier, Faith No More s  Epic  (hear its piano-led outro for proof). And sure enough, from the unexpected false starts of  Prison Song  to the relatively mellow conclusion, the band s heightened commercial sensibility continues to joust with their inherently quirky songwriting. The excellent title track,  Forest,  and  Science  are among the most accessible standouts from an incredibly diverse set, the likes of which SOAD s inferior nu-metal peers could only hope to emulate. Lyrically, it s simply no contest. Whether tackling typical rock subject matter like drug abuse ( Needles ) and groupies ( Psycho ), or embarking on inscrutable Dadaist gems like  Jet Pilot  and  Shimmy,  co-songwriters Daron Malakian and Serj Tankain sound like are the bastard children of Frank Zappa and Slayer. And while sub-Rage Against the Machine political invective (unfairly attributed to their Armenian heritage) remains an integral part of the band s creative makeup (e.g.  Deer Dance,   Atwa ), Toxicity s approach is much more cautious in this regard than that of their incendiary debut. In conclusion, when a band takes this many left turns, you d expect them to start going in circles sooner rather than later, but this is not the case with System of a Down. Hands down one of 2001 s top metal releases, Toxicity may well prove to be a lasting heavy metal classic to boot.", "Response": "Their debut in 1998 wasn't as popular.

EOS What styles of running are there? EOS That depends on what you mean by styles. Are you referencing different types of competition? Training regimens? Breathing techniques? You're supposed to be the knowledgeable one.", "Knowledge": "A recovery run is a relatively short run performed at an easy pace. Recovery runs serve to add a little mileage to a runner’s training without taking away from performance in the harder, more important workouts that precede and follow them. Recovery runs are best done as the next run after a hard workout such as an interval run. Do your recovery runs as slowly as necessary to feel relatively comfortable despite lingering fatigue from your previous run. A base run is a relatively short to moderate-length run undertaken at a runner’s natural pace. While individual base runs are not meant to be challenging, they are meant to be done frequently, and in the aggregate they stimulate big improvements in aerobic capacity, endurance, and running economy. Base runs will make up a bulk of your weekly training mileage. A progression run is a run that begins at a runner’s natural pace and ends with a faster segment at anywhere from marathon down to 10K pace. These runs are generally intended to be moderately challenging—harder than base runs but easier than most threshold and interval runs. Because they’re a medium-effort workout, the recovery time is less than more intense sessions. A tempo run is a sustained effort at lactate threshold intensity, which is the fastest pace that can be sustained for one hour in highly fit runners and the fastest pace that can be sustained for 20 minutes in less fit runners. Tempo or threshold runs serve to increase the speed you can sustain for a prolonged period of time and to increase the time you can sustain that relatively fast pace. These runs should include warm up mileage, the increased effort in the middle of the run and then cool down miles at the end. These runs can be as little as 3 miles.", "Response": "All of those things, including Base running, progression running, tempo running, recovery running, etc. Have you tried these kinds?"}

A question that might be asked is whether they are defying the ageing process. Physically, it is not possible to do this; you could slow it down, but data from the fittest ageing athletes still reports physical decline. The answer is more likely to be found in the suggestion that such athletes underperformed in their youth. It is not that people are defying age but they have learned to overcome factors such as excessively ambitious goals or being paralysed by unwanted emotions that contributed to performances in their youth.", "Response": "There is research that suggests that older atheletes have learned from their previous experiences, and thus can manage their psychological state before competition more effectively than younger competitors."}

EOS Interesting. At what distance do you start to see diminishing returns with regard to muscle growth and endurance?", "Knowledge": "1. Too much strenuous exercise and competition over too long a period of time may lead to increased mortality. A study of 1098 joggers published in 2015 showed that, as expected, joggers who trained lightly or moderately had significantly improvements in mortality. However, those that trained strenuously had death rates similar to those of inactive non-joggers. This supports a classic study published in 2014 where 55, 137 people (13,016 runners and 42,121 controls) across all ages showed that moderate running reduced all-cause deaths by 30% and heart-related deaths by 45% but that in runners running six or more times a week or approximately more than three hours a week, these benefits were reduced.", "Response": "With endurance, long-distance running builds leaner muscles, and sprinting adds bulk. There doesn't appear to be a specific distance, as it would depend on the kind of running you do, but there is a study showing that joggers who trained hard had died as much as non-joggers."}

In 1968, following a seven-year break from live performances, he returned to the stage in the acclaimed television comeback special Elvis, which led to an extended Las Vegas concert residency and a string of highly profitable tours. In 1973, Presley gave the first concert by a solo artist to be broadcast around the world, Aloha from Hawaii.

As had Dostoyevsky’s czarist Russia, Kurosawa’s Japan was going through momentous economic changes and had to brace itself against an impending catastrophe. The tortures of historical change produced in the artist a humanitarian ideal, to seek redemption through acts of self-sacrifice. In Seven Samurai, the samurai display great perseverance in protecting the farmers, their social inferiors. In the closing sequence, as the farmers joyously plant rice seedlings and sing, the surviving samurai stand by their comrades’ grave, on a mound, and sigh, “The victory belongs to those peasants, not to us.” Besides Dostoyevsky (whose novel The Idiot Kurosawa adapted to the screen in 1951), Gorky was also a significant influence. Kurosawa penned an adaptation of his The Lower Depths, bringing to the screen Gorky’s insights into lowly human behavior born out of evil, cruelty, and poverty. The warmth and moderation in human nature so cele­brated in Yasujiro Ozu’s films have no place in Kurosawa’s works. There is instead much affinity with Gorky in matters concerning the contradictions and innate antagonism in human nature, as well as the fierce struggle for survival. This also explains why Kurosawa was fond of the films of Kenji Mizoguchi, particularly those of the 1930s.", "Response": "Dostoyevsky and Gorky appear to have been"}

I would love to see those around today! EOS Yeah, the ones with the red Nike tick? They would sure stand out in a crowd today! EOS I know for me, I really like the women's Nike Pegasus, but they are so expensive. Hundred of dollars. They really do quite elegant with their lacing panel, and great for marathons. But, they cost. EOS Yeah also a good looking shoe. I also own many Nike clothing items too. EOS All new styles, or vintage? I know back in the 50s vintage wasn't trendy like it is now.

They should be staked or caged to withstand stiff breezes and because of their increased weight as they grow. Tomato plants enjoy at least 7 hours of daily sun and well-drained soil. North-facing hills and elevated, open areas in Ohio are best for planting tomatoes. A a cool-season root vegetable, carrots are hardy enough to flourish in Ohio in spring or fall, when the temperature remains below 70 degrees F. Carrots do not tolerate highly acidic soil, as some Ohio soils can be. High in fiber and vitamin A, carrots can withstand hot sun but do best when planted in early spring. Give them plenty of room to grow to their full potential by pulling some plants as they mature. Even though peppers are tropical, they can flourish during Ohio’s warm summers. Because of their origin, they are more sensitive to cooler temperatures, like those of the southern Ohio valleys. Peppers take between 65 and 80 days to mature, but unlike tomatoes they are strong enough to withstand Ohio’s windswept landscape and other hazards on their own. They grow best in fertile, well-drained soil that is consistently moist, particularly during bloom time.", "Response": "Carrots and tomatoes grow well in Ohio.

Fruit trees require a period of chill dormancy each year, and Ohio winters provide ample cold temperatures. Select trees according to the USDA temperature hardiness zone where you live. Southern Ohio is zone 6, and the central and northern areas are zone 5. Plant fruit trees as landscaping elements as well as additions to the garden. The blossoms are very attractive in the spring, and the fall foliage can be striking. Standard size trees can be used as shade trees, and dwarf trees can be used to replace ornamental shrubs in landscaping design. Apple trees thrive throughout Ohio. Golden Delicious are the best pollinators for most other apple trees, so include a Golden Delicious tree for this purpose--and, of course, for the superb apples the tree produces. Other apple varieties to plant are the traditional Red Delicious, Rome Beauty, Jonathan, Stayman and McIntosh. Two new apple crosses are Franklin and Melrose. Ohio can be home to nearly any apple variety. Peaches and nectarines are alike in every way except for the fuzz on peach skin that is absent from nectarines. Peaches and nectarines are self-fertile and do not require another variety for pollination. Peach and nectarine trees are rather tender and may suffer damage from extreme winter conditions. Late spring frosts and freezes can kill the blossoms on an entire tree, killing the crop for that year. Red Haven, Belle of Georgia and Reliance are reliable peach varieties for Ohio. Hardy nectarine varieties are Mericrest, Red Gold and Summer Beaut. These varieties offer a blend of early, mid and late season varieties. They bloom at different times, so if a late frost damages one variety, it might miss another.", "Response": "Fruit trees are an excellent choice. Apples grow very well in Ohio, as well as peaches and nectarines. If you go the bee route, Golden Delicious apples are great for pollinators"}

Spraying with a jet of water and/or insecticidal soap gets rid of the problem. Repeated sprayings will probably be necessary. Whiteflies feed off plants by sucking the plant s juices. They can cause wilting, stunting, and death. As with their relatives the aphids, mealybugs, and scale, a whitefly population can grow quickly. ​The best way to control whiteflies is to constantly monitor for them and use a combination of techniques to keep their population down. Check to be sure any new plant you buy is not infested; just moving the plant will cause them to flutter around. If you discover a small infestation in your garden, wash it off with a blast of water from the hose or by sinking the plant into a bucket of water. Sprays containing pyrethrum or neem offer some control to existing whitefly infestations. Coat both the upper and lower surfaces of leaves. Repeat applications will likely need to be made. Control the damage done by cucumber beetles by buying wilt-resistant plants and keeping plants off the ground by using a trellis. If an infestation still occurs, use a pesticide such as Rotenone or Pyrethrum on your plants. Cucumber plants are sensitive to many chemicals, so follow the label’s instructions carefully and use chemicals only as a last resort.", "Response": "Addressing pests vary with the type of plant and pest.

Understanding how to keep birds off your trees is not so difficult. If you want to know how to keep birds off your fruit trees, you need to realize there are various forms of fruit tree pest control. You can trap the birds, you can use bird netting for fruit trees to keep them from getting at the ripening fruit, and you can use chemical repellants to keep the birds and other pests away from your fruit trees. Electronic fruit tree bird protection is also available. These electronic devices will keep the birds away by emitting a sound that frightens them.", "Response": "Bird pests are more difficult to manage.

EOS Do you know what designer was responsible for Elizabeth Taylor's gown?", "Knowledge": "On Wednesday, June 26th, Christie s will auction off the first wedding gown of Elizabeth Taylor. It is a momentous occasion. Created by MGM legend Helen Rose and a gift from the studio, this influential dress is right at the crossroads of costume and fashion design. I was thrilled when its current owner (still married after wearing it for her own 1974 nuptials) reached out and invited me to inspect the ensemble before it was whisked off to London for sale. Our meeting at the Christie s offices in Beverly Hills was astounding...witnessing firsthand the level of quality and craftsmanship that came from the team at MGM. Christie s then honored me further by asking me to write the article that accompanies the gown in the auction catalog. That article is reprinted below and I ve followed it with photographs that help illustrate the story of this iconic gown. The real star and center of this “wedding of weddings” was this dress. A gift from MGM and designed by their legendary costume designer Helen Rose, it was (and still is) so extraordinary that photographs of it have appeared all over the world--from newspapers to tabloids to LIFE magazine. Today it appears in the pages of fashion and continues to act as inspiration to the industry; in fact, this off-the-shoulder illusion gown has become iconic. With “25 yards of shell-white satin sprinkled with bugle beads and tiny seed pearls trailed by 15 yards of satin train,” it is exactly the kind of elegant design for which Helen Rose was known. She always started by sourcing the most luxurious of fabrics, and there’s a special luminous depth to the satin in this gown. It exudes a warm glow in certain light that looks beautiful against the skin. And, according to current owner, the fabric even sounds beautiful…there is a soft slow swishing whenever one moves across the room. Everything about this gown was custom designed with Elizabeth Taylor in mind. Since she was celebrated for her voluptuous figure, Helen added a built-in corset to the dress so it could be “tightly cinched to emphasize Elizabeth’s waist and bust.” Apparently, they took that as far as they could; it’s reported that Elizabeth gasped when she was sewn in on the day of the wedding. Even the veil of “10 yards of shimmering silk illusion net” was carefully considered and attached to a pearl-covered Juliet cap in order to fairly float around Elizabeth. The project was so extensive and had such priority at MGM that 15 people worked full-time (likely more) for two to three months straight on it. It took several people just to complete the painstaking pearl and beadwork. The level of craftsmanship of this garment is so high it would be near impossible to recreate. That’s the magic of Helen Rose and might of MGM.", "Response": "It was created by Helen Rose. The dress features a built-in corset to show off your figure."}

Wrap hair flat around the curling barrel, and make sure that there are no spaces between the wraps of hair around the barrel. You should curl your hair between 10-15 seconds so that it sets. After that, release the curl into your palm and let it set for a few seconds. You can use a one-inch barrel to create tight curls if you work with smaller sections of hair. Place a very small section on the barrel. Compared with classic curl, the tight curl needs space between the wraps.", "Response": "You might want to try the classic curl technique. Wrap the hair flat around your curling iron barrel (one inch), with no spaces between the wrapped strands. Curl it for no more than 10 or 15 seconds, then let it go into your palm to set for several seconds. This may help create those curls more easily."}
{"Context": "I like to come up with new hairstyles. I often style my kids' hair for fun. EOS I have been working on new styles for my 11 year old daughter's hair. It is so fine and hard to keep smooth. What new hairstyle should I try for her tomorrow for school? EOS For fine hair that's hard to control, short hairstyles are recommended. The secret is finding the right balance, You need to weight the amount of time and effort you want to give to the hair with the effectiveness of the results. EOS That is a good idea. My problem is that she wants to keep her long hair. She loves the let if fly when she runs but it gets it so tangled. I need something that will be easy to do with her fine hair but keep it under control. What else can I do with long fine hair besides braids? EOS Using highlights can provide a nice sense of contrast to fine hair, giving it a fuller look and adding a sense of greater body. Given that you want to avoid braids, maybe a half-braid updo would work. It's a way of having the best of both worlds without committing entirely to braids. EOS I might try that. Thanks. She might be more willing if there was some of her hair flying free. With my hair, it is long and thick. I usually resort to pony tails because I am in a hurry. What suggestions do you have to quickly style long thick hair? EOS For quick hairstyling when your hair is long and thick, consider a middle part with wavy curls. A loose curl helps frame many faces well. You also might try a loose bun, which creates a polished but casual look without an excess amount of effort. EOS I like the loose bun idea but am excited about curls. My hair is kind of wavy but does not really create great curls. Is there a way to help bring out the curls in my hair? EOS A small amount of styling gel can define curls in wavy hair without drying it out or making it overly stiff. Brush your hair with a wide-tooth comb to separate the strands and dry it with a microfiber cloth. Then use a diffuser to play down the waves and make the curls more prominent.

It seems as if everyone either wants their hair to be curlier or straighter but never really happy with what we have. I just tried some semi-permanent hair dye last month.

In this poll, 41% of the 776 people polled said that they watched the show regularly, and 61% of this group (194 people, or 25% of the total) disagreed with the idea that the show portrayed Italian Americans in a negative light. Professor Roberts stated:  The show helped to perpetuate one of the more problematic and stereotypical images of Italian Americans. Both Italian and Italian American cultures have much more diverse and interesting heritages than the American public generally realizes. [170] Humanities professor Camille Paglia, herself an Italian American, has spoken negatively about The Sopranos, arguing that its depiction of Italian Americans was inaccurate, inauthentic, and dated.[171] All six seasons were released as DVD box sets, with the final season released in two parts; two different versions of the complete series were also released. The sixth season (both parts 1 and 2) was also released on Blu-ray Disc and HD DVD in 2006 and 2007, respectively.

Modern shows like Lost, Breaking Bad, Game of Thrones, Mad Men, Boardwalk Empire, Homeland, and countless others would not even exist in their capacity without the overwhelming critical and pop-culture success of The Sopranos. It changed the way audiences viewed television and the possibilities long-form storytelling had. The saying on the sleeve of the outer box says the tagline  Family. Redefined.  It s more like  Television. Redefined.  Television has never been the same as ambitious, long-form, and serialized storytelling has shifted into being one of the norms of quality television.

Chris Price (cropped) The building, modular in plan, is laid out on a three-lobed footprint that is an abstract rendering of the local Hymenocallis flower. The Y-shaped plan plays a central role in the reduction of wind forces on the tower. A hexagonal central core is buttressed by a series of wings, each with its own concrete core and perimeter columns. As the tower increases in height, the wings step back in a spiral configuration, changing the building’s shape at each tier and so reducing the effect of the wind on the building. The central core emerges at the tower’s top and is finished with a spire, which reaches more than 700 feet (200 metres). The spire was constructed inside the tower and hoisted to its final position using a hydraulic pump. At the foundational level, the tower is supported by a reinforced concrete mat nearly 13 feet (4 metres) thick, itself supported by concrete piles 5 feet (1.5 metres) in diameter. A three-story podium anchors the tower in place; the podium and two-story basement alone measure some 2,000,000 square feet (186,000 square metres) in their own right. The tower’s exterior cladding is made up of aluminum and stainless-steel panels, vertical stainless-steel tubular fins, and more than 28,000 hand-cut glass panels.

Charlie’s lack of intelligence has made him a trusting and friendly man, as he assumes that the people in his life—most notably, his coworkers at Donner’s Bakery—are as well intentioned as he is. As his intelligence grows, however, Charlie gains perspective on his past and present. He realizes that people have often taken advantage of him and have been cruel to him for sport, knowing that he would not understand. Likewise, he realizes that when people have been kind to him, it usually has been out of condescension or out of an awareness that he is inferior. These realizations cause Charlie to grow suspicious of nearly everyone around him. Interestingly, the experimental operation elevates Charlie’s intelligence to such an extent that his new genius distances him from people as much as his disability does. Charlie eventually convinces himself that he has lost feeling even for Alice Kinnian, the one person whom he feels has never betrayed him and the only one for whom he has maintained a deep affection throughout his life.", "Response": "What did you think of Charlie's transformation?

Here, we see what happens after George Washington leaves office and John Adams takes over. Hamilton (played by Lin-Manuel Miranda) loses his seat, Adams insults him and Hamilton shoots back.

The search for water on the Red Planet has taken more than 15 years to turn up definitive signs that liquid flows on the surface today. In the past, however, rivers and oceans may have covered the land. Where did all of the liquid water go? Why? How much of it still remains? Where is the water today? Liquid water appears to flow from some steep, relatively warm slopes on the Martian surface. Features known as recurring slope lineae (RSL) were first identified in 2011in images taken by the High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (HiRISE) camera aboard the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO). The dark streaks, which appear seasonally, were confirmed to be signs of salty water running on the surface of the planet. The detection of hydrated salts on these slopes means that water plays a vital role in the formation of these streaks,  the study s lead author, Lujendra Ojha, of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta, said in a statement. Vast deposits of water appear to be trapped within the ice caps at the north and south poles of the planet. Each summer, as temperatures increase, the caps shrink slightly as their contents skip straight from solid to gas form, but in the winter, cooler temperatures cause them to grow to latitudes as low as 45 degrees, or halfway to the equator. The caps are an average of 2 miles (3 kilometers) thick and, if completely melted, could cover the Martian surface with about 18 feet (5.6 meters) of water. Frozen water also lies beneath the surface. Scientists discovered a slab of ice as large as California and Texas combined in the region between the equator and north pole of the Red Planet. The presence of subsurface water has long been suspected but required the appearance of strange layered craters to confirm. Other regions of the planet may contain frozen water, as well. Some high-latitude regions seem to boast patterned ground-shapes that may have formed as permafrost in the soil freezes and thaws over time.", "Response": "Do you think that's why there are traces of water on Mars and ice underground?

By the time the mid-1800s came along, chocolate was produced in powder form and the very first chocolate bar was developed by Joseph Fry in 1947. After his creation, in came the chocolate revolution with companies like Nestlé and Cadbury emerging to break into this new industry and produce the hand-held candy bar that can be purchased just about anywhere nowadays. Clearly, the world just can’t get enough of chocolate, and for one reason or another, this is the way it has always been throughout history. In fact, the Spaniards once kept chocolate a secret from countries nearby for about 100 years, so they wouldn’t have to share it. Who else can relate to keeping chocolate hidden somewhere in the house, in a secret location so that family members or roommates can’t find it? Meanwhile, the Aztecs used chocolate as a currency, much like neighborhood street kids looking to swap their favorite Pokémon card for taste of sweet heaven.", "Response": "It  has been like  that for thousands of years.

There are several different ways to do this. Journaling, as a stress management and self-exploration tool, works best when done consistently, but even occasional, sporadic journaling can be stress relieving when the practice is focused on gratitude or emotional processing. One of the most effective ways to reduce stress with journaling is to write in detail about feelings and thoughts related to stressful events, as one would discuss topics in therapy, and brainstorm solutions, but there are several different ways to practice journaling. The method you choose can depend on your needs at the time, and your personality; just do what feels right. Journaling allows people to clarify their thoughts and feelings, thereby gaining valuable self-knowledge. It’s also a good problem-solving tool; oftentimes, one can hash out a problem and come up with solutions more easily on paper. Journaling about traumatic events helps one process them by fully exploring and releasing the emotions involved, and by engaging both hemispheres of the brain in the process, allowing the experience to become fully integrated within one’s mind. Journaling can also help you to focus on areas of your life that you re like to focus on more often, as is the case with gratitude journaling or even coincidence journaling.", "Response": "Sounds like maybe you enjoy journaling to clarify your thoughts and feelings?

The early Bruins teams featured future Hall of Fame members Eddie Shore, Aubrey (“Dit”) Clapper, and Cecil (“Tiny”) Thompson, among others. The Bruins took home two more Stanley Cups, after the 1938–39 and 1940–41 seasons, behind goal-keeping great Frank Brimsek. They returned to the Stanley Cup finals five more times between 1943 and 1958 but lost on each occasion. Future Hall of Fame defenseman Ray Bourque joined the Bruins in 1979 and quickly became the new face of the franchise, playing for the team for almost two decades. The Bruins consistently contended during this period, as evidenced by their NHL-record 29 consecutive play-off appearances between 1968 and 1996, but they often played second fiddle to teams such as the Montreal Canadiens and the Edmonton Oilers.", "Response": "Bruins is one of the best teams, having won 6 championships, they have a solid foundation. would be amazing is Ray Bourque was still young enough to play with the Bruins, Bruins would dominate."}

EOS It's a movie directed by Ozu.", "Knowledge": "Yasujiro Ozu has been widely touted as the most Japanese of Japanese film directors. In fact, Japanese distributors initially refused to release Ozu s work abroad, fearing that the West wouldn t appreciate its subtle beauty at a time when films of Akira Kurosawa and Kenji Mizoguchi were winning award after award at international film festivals. Fortunately, such fears proved to be unfounded and Ozu is now recognized as one of cinema s truly great filmmakers.Yasujiro Ozu was born in the old Fukagawa district of Tokyo, to a fertilizer merchant, in 1903. He proved to be an indifferent student in middle and high school, frequently choosing to watch movies rather than tend to his studies. Later in life, he proudly recalled how he watched Rex Ingram s Prisoner of Zenda when he should have been taking the entrance examination for the Kobe Higher Commercial School. In 1923, after a couple of years as an assistant teacher in rural Japan, Ozu was hired as assistant cameraman at the Shochiku Motion Picture Company. Early in his career, Ozu began to experiment with an idiosyncratic film style that ran contrary to the conventions of Japanese or Hollywood cinema of the day. He strove to reduce and simplify his film style. He cast such mainstays as the fade, the dissolve, and the pan from his cinematic palette. He shot solely from a low camera angle, using a 50mm lens, and he subordinated spatial continuity to visual aesthetics.Ozu directed his first film in 1927, an otherwise unremarkable period film called The Sword of Penitence. In 1932, he began to hit his creative stride with the touching comedy I Was Born, But..., which was his first commercial success and is considered to be one of his finest pre-World War II movies. It was also at this time that Ozu began to develop his signature film style. During World War II, he made few films and those that he did, such as There Was a Father, all but ignored the conflict. After the war, Ozu reached his creative peak and made some of his finest films, including Late Spring, Early Summer, Floating Weeds, An Autumn Afternoon, and his masterpiece Tokyo Story, which is generally considered one of the greatest films ever made. Far from the muscular narratives of Kurosawa samurai epics, the films of Ozu are simple, contemplative, and edged with nostalgia and sadness. Through the course of his long career, from 1927 to 1962, Ozu refined and narrowed the scope of his films to the bare essentials. His oeuvre, which is almost completely confined to that of domestic dramas or shomen-geki, is thematically quite coherent from one film to the next. Though the particulars of the characters might differ, they are all snugly enmeshed in the same quiet world. There are no heroes or villains, no wild successes or great failures. his characters are ordinary people leading ordinary lives. Conflict arises from natural changes in the relationship between parent and child, be it a daughter who is reluctant to marry and abandon her widowed father in Late Spring or a pair of young sons who realize the modest social position of their father in I Was Born, But.... Ozu s remarkable sensitivity to the human condition and his nuanced understanding of the patterns of everyday life give these seemingly mundane conflicts a tremendous emotional power rarely found in conventional Hollywood dramas.Late in his career, Ozu became the target of criticism by the iconoclastic directors of the Japanese New Wave. Many decried his film style as rigid, while others criticized his refusal to address social issues. His quiet, transcendent vision of humanity, however, has stood the test of time and has been an influence on such diverse Western directors as Wim Wenders, Jim Jarmusch, and Martin Scorsese. Ozu died of cancer in 1962.", "Response": "I have read that Ozu is now recognized as one of cinema's greatest filmmakers. Have you seen other films by Ozu?"}

I particularly enjoy \"Late Spring.\"", "Knowledge": "This film not only was a change in technique and tenor for Ozu, from more socially blunt works, but marked the beginning of the final phase of Ozu’s long career, where his focus became almost exclusively the Japanese family unit in the post-war transition years, and his camera movement started to become more and more static with every film released. The film was penned by Ozu and longtime collaborator Kôgo Noda, from a novel called Father And Daughter, by Kazuo Hirotsu. The very naturalistic screenplay and camera work lends an air of realism to Ozu’s style that has often been compared to Italian Neo-Realism of the same era, although Ozu’s work from this era was never as overtly political as that of the Italian filmmakers. The film follows the life of an aging father, a professor, Shukichi Somiya (Chishu Ryu), and his twenty-seven year old daughter, Noriko (Setsuko Hara), who still lives at home. Worried over her ending up alone, and prodded on by Noriko’s aunt Masa Taguchi (Haruko Sugimura), sister of Shukichi or his wife (it’s never delineated), he tries to push his daughter out of the nest and into marital bliss. We never learn what happened to the wife and mother of the household, but we can guess she was killed in the war. We do learn that Noriko was in a labor camp and was very ill and skinny, but has now gotten healthy and plump, according to one of Shukichi’s Academic colleagues, Jo Onodera (Masao Mishima), whose remarriage Noriko deems distasteful and filthy. Onodera is a jovial man, and merely one of many who seems to obsess on Noriko’s marital status.", "Response": "If I remember correctly, this was the time when Ozu's technique started to change in his films, as this was getting near the end of his career."}

However since the films release it has dominated “best of” lists, featuring inside the top 10 of Sight and Sounds decennial list since 1992 and topping the 2012 directors poll. It has long since been a checklist film among film lovers to admire and tick off.

Like other countries across the world a generation of men had been lost and the women who had worked the factories and shops were reluctant to return home. It seems fitting that Ozu, the most Japanese of directors, would be the first to catch on to the rapid infiltration of American culture, in a handbag or a Coca-Cola sign or more importantly, a challenge to traditional societal value of marriage. Marriage in a number of forms is discussed over the course of Late Spring, and it repeatedly ends in resounding negativity. Ozu, one must be reminded, stayed single his whole life. Noriko continually defies her father’s attempts to arrange a marriage, until he breaks her trust and concocts a phony remarriage to sway her hand. Those who refer to Noriko as a saintly, loyal daughter are too quick to condense Ozu’s characters to symbols. The complexities of the human condition are hidden in gestures or the quiet temperance of the everyday. Noriko continually displays stubbornness, traits of jealousy, and possession over her father’s right to remarry, though it is all veiled behind a smile.", "Response": "Were all of his films post war films?"}

As has always been the case, there was no blueprint for what they wanted the full-length to be, rather letting it develop naturally with instruments in their hands. “Towards the end of the ‘A Skeletal Domain’ cycle we did talk about having some riffs that breathe a little more, but that was about it. When everybody started writing I believe it actually became a feel thing more than it ever has been with us,” says Mazurkiewicz. “That it wound up being a really raw, mostly straightforward kind of album wasn’t part of a big plan or anything,” Webster asserts. “We just tried to write the best songs we could, and this is how they turned out.” The aforementioned aggression, rawness and catchiness leap out from the speaker as soon as the listener hits play, “Only One Will Die” perhaps the most ruthless yet immediate album opener 2017 has seen. What follows is a relentless barrage of ferocious music that maintains the insanely high standards the unit have long held themselves to, and while there is a great diversity in dynamics there is never a let up in intensity. The devastating “Firestorm Vengeance”, for instance, sounds like the work of men only the most foolhardy would choose to mess with, likewise the title track and ultra-belligerent “Destroyed Without A Trace”. The vile, lurching passages of “Code Of The Slashers” play menacingly off against bloodthirsty thrashings, while “Scavenger Consuming Death” stands out as one of the heaviest additions to one of the weightiest catalogs in extreme music. With “Remaimed” – penned by O’Brien – unleashing some sickening tones that sound wrought from an instrument designed to devastate everything and the eerie droning breaking into “Hideous Ichor”, new flavors have been introduced to their sonic palette this time out. “We’re always looking for ways to move our sound forward while maintaining the style we’ve developed over the years,” Webster states. “I think we managed to do that with ‘Red Before Black’ – it has some new ideas, but you’ll also hear things on this album that would sound at home on our earlier releases. We want to grow as a band while staying true to our roots“.", "Response": "Ha sick!  Are you a fan of earlier Chris Barnes or the new singer Corpsegrinder?"}

Strong-jawed and wiry, he has commented that his looks make him ideal for playing the boy next door -- if you happen to live next door to a mausoleum.Although his screen persona may suggest otherwise, Dafoe is the product of a fairly conventional Midwestern upbringing. The son of a surgeon and one of seven siblings, he was born on July 22, 1955 in Appleton, Wisconsin. Dafoe began acting as a teenager, and at the age of seventeen he enrolled at the University of Wisconsin in Milwaukee. Growing weary of the university s theatre department, where he found that temperament was all too often a substitute for talent, he joined Milwaukee s experimental Theatre X troupe. After touring stateside and throughout Europe with the group, Dafoe moved to New York in 1977, where he joined the avant-garde Wooster Group. Dafoe s 1981 film debut was a decidedly mixed blessing, as it consisted of a minor role in Michael Cimino s disastrous Heaven s Gate . Ultimately, Dafoe s screen time was cut from the film s final release print, saving him the embarrassment of being associated with the film but also making him something of a nonentity. He went on to appear in such films as The Hunger (1983) and To Live and Die in L.A. (1985) before making his breakthrough in Platoon (1986). His portrayal of the insouciant, pot-smoking Sgt. Elias earned him Hollywood recognition and a Best Supporting Actor Oscar nomination.Choosing his projects based on artistic merit rather than box office potential, Dafoe subsequently appeared in a number of widely divergent films, often taking roles that enhanced his reputation as one of the American cinema s most predictably unpredictable actors. After starring as an idealistic FBI agent in Mississippi Burning (1988), he took on one of his most memorable and controversial roles as Jesus in Martin Scorsese s The Last Temptation of Christ (1988). Dafoe then portrayed a paralyzed, tormented Vietnam vet in Born on the Fourth of July (1989), his second collaboration with Oliver Stone. Homicidal tendencies and a mouthful of rotting teeth followed when he played an ex-marine in David Lynch s Wild at Heart (1990), before he got really weird and allowed Madonna to drip hot wax on his naked body in Body of Evidence (1992). Following a turn in Wim Wenders  Faraway, So Close in 1993, Dafoe entered the realm of the blockbuster with his role as a mercenary in Clear and Present Danger (1994). That same year, he earned acclaim for his portrayal of T.S. Eliot in Tom and Viv, one of the few roles that didn t paint the actor as a contemporary head case.

The show originally aired on AMC for five seasons, from January 20, 2008, to September 29, 2013. Set and filmed in Albuquerque, New Mexico, the series tells the story of Walter White (Bryan Cranston), an underemployed and depressed high school chemistry teacher who is struggling with both midlife crisis and a recent diagnosis of stage-3 lung cancer. Together with his former student Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul), White turns to a life of crime by producing and selling crystallized methamphetamine to secure his family s financial future before he dies, while navigating the dangers of the criminal underworld. The title comes from the Southern colloquialism  breaking bad  which means to turn to a life of immorality or crime.[8] Gilligan characterized the series as showing Walter s transformation from a soft-spoken Mr. Chips into Scarface.", "Response": "Mike was a retired cop from Philadelphia."}

Most, but by no means all, were of Lowland Scottish or northern English ancestry and perhaps two-thirds were of Presbyterian tradition (others being Anglican, Quaker, or Catholic), having forebears who crossed the Irish Channel following King James I s Ulster Plantation of the early 1600 s and who settled primarily in four counties on Ireland s northeastern coast.14 After leaving Ulster for North America in the 1700s, the Scotch-Irish landed overwhelmingly in the Delaware Valley and moved westward. They and their descendants became the dominant group in much of the hinterland (or back country), populating the interior of Pennsylvania, Virginia, the Carolinas, and Georgia and positioning their descendants at the headwaters of the Ohio River and in the Carolina Piedmont, from which the lower Midwest and much of the interior South were settled in the early-nineteenth century. They were especially numerous in the Southeast, constituting one-half of the white population of South Carolina and Georgia by the end of the eighteenth century.15 Long-time Tennessee state historian Wilma Dykeman stated that in the early days  the dominant character of Tennesseans came to be identified with that of the Scotch-Irish. 16 Surname research has estimated that Americans of Ulster extraction formed roughly one-sixth of the European-derived population by the first U.S. census of 1790.", "Response": "I have learned many Scotch-Irish moved to North America in the 1700s."}

That sea route was driven by the important trade that linked the port of Philadelphia with Ulster ports. After unloading their American cargoes in Ulster, ship captains filled their vessels with emigrants for the return trip. As more and more Ulster people traveled to America, encouraging tales of its widespread opportunities flowed back to Ulster. This migration grew steadily until the outbreak of the American Revolution; after a decade of interruption by war, it picked up again at a slower pace until the 1820s.", "Response": "The majority of Scotch-Irish immigrants landed in Pennsylvania.

TSR then divided the license among multiple publishers.[3] TSR awarded Interplay Productions, Inc. a license to use the Forgotten Realms and Planescape trademarks and associated properties for use in computer and video game products.[4] Within Interplay, a division named Black Isle Studios used this license arrangement to develop a series of successful games based upon the two D&D settings. They also published the Baldur s Gate series developed by the Canadian company BioWare. In 2003, Interplay ran into financial difficulties, resulting in the closure of Black Isle Studios. Their next planned D&D video game, code-named  Jefferson,  was canceled as a result of legal issues with Wizards of the Coast, the new rights holders to the D&D franchise.[5] Wizards of the Coast purchased TSR, the makers of Dungeons & Dragons, in 1997. They in turn were acquired by Hasbro in 1999. As a result, the subsidiary Hasbro Interactive gained the right to use the Dungeons & Dragons game brand in their video game products. In 2001, facing financial difficulties, Hasbro sold 100% of Hasbro Interactive to French software concern Infogrames Entertainment, SA in a US$100 million deal.[6] This led to the publication of Neverwinter Nights in 2002, a game also developed by Bioware.", "Response": "The first video game license for dungeons and dragons was awarded in 1987.

The Greek army was led by Leonidas, who was estimated to have had around 7,000 men. Xerxes, on the other hand, had anywhere from 70,000 to 300,000. Despite the disparity in numbers, the Greeks were able to maintain their position. Their strategy involved holding a line only a few dozen yards long between a steep hillside and the sea. This constricted the battlefield and prevented the Persians from utilizing their vast numbers. For two days the Greeks defended against Persian attacks and suffered light losses as they imposed heavy casualties on the Persian army.

Scottie Pippen was born September 25, 1965 in Hamburg, Arkansas. He played in the National Basketball Association and is most noted for his time with the Chicago Bulls, with whom he was instrumental in earning six of their NBA titles and their record 1995–96 season of 72 wins. Pippen, along with Michael Jordan, played an important role in transforming the Bulls team into a vehicle for popularizing the NBA around the world during the  90s. Considered one of the best small forwards of all time, Pippen was named to the NBA All-Defensive First Team eight consecutive times and the All-NBA First Team three times. He was a seven-time NBA All-Star and was the NBA All-Star Game MVP in 1994. He was named one of the 50 Greatest Players in NBA History during the 1996–97 season and is one of only four players to have his jersey (No. 33) retired by the Chicago Bulls. His college, University of Central Arkansas, retired his number No. 33 as well. Pippen is a two-time inductee into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame (for his individual career and as a member of the  Dream Team ), being inducted for both on August 13, 2010. In January 2008, Pippen made a brief comeback to professional basketball at age 42 when he made a tour of Scandinavia and played two games for top Finnish league team Torpan Pojat (ToPo) and top Swedish league team Sundsvall. Pippen returned to the Bulls on July 15, 2010 as a team ambassador. In 2012, he was named senior advisor to Michael Reinsdorf, the Bulls  president and COO. Renowned for his defensive abilities, having made the NBA All Defensive Team ten consecutive years during his career and leading the league in steals in 1994–95, Phil Jackson once described Pippen as a  one-man wrecking crew , capable of guarding anyone from the point guard to the center position. Pippen is remembered as one of the most versatile and agile players, and perhaps most notably as one of the greatest defenders ever. His intense work ethic and athletic physique gave him the ability to consistently make highlight-reel plays, such as applying defensive intensity, forcing a turnover, stealing the ball and starting a one-man fast break that he would finish with a thunderous slam dunk.", "Response": "I read the other day that Scottie Pippen is worth $50 million these days?

Pip was selected fifth overall in the 1987 NBA draft by the Seattle SuperSonics. However, a few weeks later, he was traded to Chicago Bulls for Olden Polynice and a draft pick. After a moderate rookie season where he earned $725,000 in salary, Pippen proved himself in the 1988/1989 season. First, he landed a berth in the starting team for the first time and then, led the team to her first ever conference semi in over 10 years. In 1992, they also became the first players ever to win an NBA title and Olympic gold medal in the same year as they both played for the first US Dream team in the 1992 Barcelona Olympics.

During the industrial revolution, companies started many of today’s big clubs—like Arsenal and Manchester United—which pitted workers against each other.

Chocolates with the countries’ names attached are generally associated with quality, despite the obvious fact that neither country grows its own cocoa. The reason why all comes down to manufacturing history (and the marketing budgets of powerful companies). The Swiss chocolate and Belgian chocolate names aren’t as protected in international markets as other famous European foods. You can’t call a sparkling wine Champagne unless it’s produced in Champagne, France, or a cheese Parmigiano-Reggiano unless it’s made in a specific region in Italy. Swiss and Belgian chocolates lack similar European Union legal backing. That doesn’t mean either lacks distinct stylistic qualities, though, as businesses have banded together to set standards.

Are you a basketball fan?", "Knowledge": "Brown’s demeanor makes it easy to forget that the number three overall pick in the 2016 draft will only be 22 years old heading into the 2018-19 season. Brown made the leap from inconsistent rookie to much-improved sophomore last season, significantly upping his production in every aspect of his game, except free throw shooting. Heading into his third season, Brown is entrenched as one of Boston s keystones, but his immediate value is difficult to gauge, given the return of Gordon Hayward from injury. Possessions will be harder to come by this season with Hayward and Kyrie Irving, who also missed a chunk of time last season, back in action, but if Brown can continue to defend at an elite level and hit close to 40 percent of his three-pointers, as he did last year, Boston will find a way to get him shots. Even so, how he ll fit within the best collection of talent in the East is a major question mark, particularly after the emergence of Jayson Tatum, who may be the most untouchable player on the league s deepest roster. At the very least, Brown should be able to closely replicate last season s production, perhaps with a slight downturn in scoring if Hayward returns at 100 percent. Whether Brown can maintain his three-point efficiency, as well as improve at the charity stripe, will also be something for Fantasy owners to keep an eye on. Read Past Outlooks", "Response": "Yes.

How do you play it?", "Knowledge": "Arkham Horror: The Card Game is produced by Fantasy Flight Games. It is a cooperative game set in the universe of Chaosium s Call of Cthulhu roleplaying game which is itself based on the Cthulhu Mythos of H.P. Lovecraft and other cosmic horror writers. The title refers to Lovecraft s fictional town of Arkham, MA which is mentioned in many Mythos stories. News of the game was originally leaked in May 2016,[2] before being officially announced in August of that same year.[3] It made its first limited public release at Arkham Nights 2016 to a sold out crowd. During the game the players are working together against an Agenda deck and encounter deck that act as a timer for how long the players have to complete their objectives and direct opposition to their actions. Each turn a doom token will be added to the Agenda. When the total number of doom in play reaches the number of the agenda card, the agenda will advance. The players succeed by completing an Act deck – generally a number of clues per investigator are needed to pass each Act – alternatively a specific condition needs to be reached to complete an Act. Arkham Horror is an adventure board game designed by Richard Launius, originally published in 1987 by Chaosium. The game is based on Chaosium's roleplaying game \"Call of Cthulhu\", which is set in the Cthulhu Mythos of H.P. Lovecraft and other horror writers. It was revised and reprinted by Fantasy Flight Games in 2005. In this game, players take on the role of investigators in Lovecraft's Massachusetts town of Arkham. Gates to other planes open throughout the town. If too many gates open, a powerful alien being will enter, likely destroying the town and possibly threatening the world. The investigators must avoid or fight alien creatures that enter Arkham through the gates, enter the gates themselves, survive the alien places beyond, return to Arkham, and close the gates. The game board is set in Lovecraft's fictional city of Arkham during 1926. Street, building and outdoor locations are featured, as well as otherworldly locations that investigators can venture into. Players each have an investigator, represented by a character card. Each investigator has several attributes (such as \"sanity\"), and cards representing items, spells, and other things. As game play progresses, gates to these other worlds open and are represented by tokens placed on the board. Monsters from the other worlds enter through the gates and wander the city. The investigators travel through the city, avoiding or fighting the monsters, visiting city locations to acquire tools, and ultimately entering the gates. After traveling through the other world and returning, the investigator can try to close the gate. While exploring city locations or other worlds, the investigators face random events which may benefit or harm them. As gates open, a \"Doom Track\" advances; if the track reaches its end, a powerful horrific creature known as the Ancient One breaks through into Arkham. In the 1987 edition of the game, this ends the game, and all players lose. In the 2005 edition, this (in most cases) begins an endgame in which the players have a small chance to defeat the creature and win; otherwise they lose.", "Response": "The players work together to investigate a Lovecraftian-type horror. The times I played; it was Cthulhu who tried to take over the world. Instead of dice, you use cards to move forward in the story."}

The blue colour of their uniform has also earned them the nickname of  Men in Blue . With the advent of the World Series Cup in the 1970s, each team was to don a primary and secondary colour on their uniforms. The Indian team elected to wear light-blue as their primary colour and yellow as their secondary colour. Even during the 1999 Cricket World Cup the secondary colour on the Indian cricket team s clothing has been yellow. However, this has since been removed and replaced with the tricolour. However, in the past the Indian ODI outfits were changed to different shades of blue, mostly darker than the current, and the team donned purple during 1992, and then the sky blue colour for the next decade. Indian team has got a new kit from 2009 which is feroza blue with India written on it in Orange. Currently, from October 2010, the team is once again using a light blue shade though not as light as the previous sky blue one, with India written in orange, and shades of the tri-colour at the sides.

Within seven weeks of its release, \"California Gurls\" sold over two million downloads, which is the second fastest pace to do so in digital history behind Flo Rida's \"Right Round\". It debuted at number 31 on the \"Billboard\" Radio Songs chart and in the July 10, 2010, issue it reached number one on the magazine's Hot Dance Airplay chart, giving Perry her second number-one single on that chart.

It took only three weeks to reach #1 and earned Katy Perry her best single sales week selling over 557,000 copies in its first full week of release. A lush tropical-themed music video accompanied the song and was filmed at the Los Angeles County Arboretum and Botanic Garden. Controversy was raised over perceived similarities between the sound of  Roar  and Sara Bareilles   Brave,  but Sara Bareilles put an end to perceptions of conflict between the performers.  Roar  earned Grammy Award nominations for Song of the Year and Best Pop Solo Performance. It reached #1 across the mainstream pop, adult pop, and adult contemporary radio charts as well as topping the dance chart. Sweet! Katy Perry re-imagines the Golden State as a Candyland-like fantasy world in her just-released “California Gurls” video. The scantily-clad singer saunters through a sugary wonderland while freeing imprisoned gurls who have been trapped in confectionary confinement by Snoop Dogg.

After recording the stripped-down live album MTV Unplugged (2009), Perry returned to the studio. The resulting release, Teenage Dream (2010), which provided a broader showcase for her full-throated voice, was even more commercially successful than One of the Boys, spawning such hits as the warm-weather frivolity “California Gurls” (featuring rapper Snoop Dogg) and the inspirational “Firework.” When “Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F.)” reached the top of the Billboard Hot 100 chart in mid-2011, Perry tied Michael Jackson’s record of five number one songs from a single album. She maintained her grip on the mainstream with her next release, Prism (2013), which produced, among other hits, the anthemic “Roar.” Her 2016 single “Rise” was featured in television coverage of that year’s Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro. Perry’s fourth studio album, Witness (2017), more introspective than her earlier work, was less well received.", "Response": "Tropical clothing sounds so fun - I wish I could see your designs!

Those are the claims coming from of the tabloids, but Gossip Cop is told the story is off-base.

Additionally, the purported tipster also contends the British star would “love” for his son Flynn to “have a little brother or sister.” Actually, he already does. It was just reported that Flynn’s mom Miranda Kerr gave birth to a baby boy earlier this week. It’s strange that the publication’s “source” is acting like Bloom’s son would be sibling-less unless his father has another child when it was known for months he was going to become a big brother in due course. Additionally, while People recently reported that Perry and Bloom are dating exclusively again, with their dynamic seeming “more serious” than in the past, the reputable magazine said absolutely nothing about the pair committing to one another with a marriage and children. That’s because, Gossip Cop has learned, their future doesn’t hold such plans at this time. While a rep for Perry did not return a request for comment and Bloom’s spokesperson declined to speak on the record, Gossip Cop is told by a contact close to him that it’s “not true” he and Perry plan to marry this winter and start a family.", "Response": "Oh my gosh, isn't Daisy just the cutest?

Why? It comes down to consistency of vision and execution. Marvel Studios — led by Kevin Feige and a cast of thousands — has produced a startling number of movies over the last decade with only two, or maybe three, missteps. From a relatively intimate movie like Ant-Man to a gigantic spectacle like Infinity War, Marvel’s movies are almost always entertaining, especially when taking into account such substantial tonal shifts from one film to the next. Captain America: The Winter Soldier and Guardians of the Galaxy — two other examples — could not be more different in theme and scope and yet both are terrific in their own right — and at the same time very much feel like they are part of the same worldview.", "Response": "The MCU films are amazing, they're really varied in scope and tone but always so entertaining."}

The thrash metal band had a devoted following all through the Eighties, but the release of Cowboys From Hell brought them to a huge audience, which only grew two years later when they dropped Vulgar Display of Power. Long-simmering tensions between frontman Phil Anselmo and guitarist Dimebag Darrell reached a boiling point in 2003 and the band split up. The next year, Dimebag was touring with his new band, Damageplan (also featuring his brother and Pantera drummer Vinnie Paul), when a deranged fan killed him onstage in Columbus, Ohio.

EOS definitely the Metallica show in 94'. I saw them in Mountain View, and it was by far the best show. They had tons of pyro and did a 45 minute encore! Do you listen to any other metal bands EOS That sounds insane, I love it when a band adds a good pyro show! I like Deftones and Machine Head, what other bands do you like? EOS Deftones are really good, but they went downhill after White Pony imo. I think Gojira and mastodon are good for newer metal, oh and I've been really into Messhuga lately too. EOS Agreed, I only listen to older Deftones stuff. I've never heard much Gojira but I like Meshuggah, especially 'Nothing' from 2002. EOS That's a good one! I love the crazy drums and fun jazz notes. It's always cool when a band can take other genres and weave them into metal. I can't wait to see whose going to be play at sxsw this year. Have you ever been to a music festival? EOS I've never properly attended anything bigger than a small Jazzfest or Blues & BBQ event. However I once inadvertently was at SXSW! I happened to be visiting a friend in Austin at the right time, and we caught a few minor shows. What's your favorite music festival? EOS That's cool. SXSW is always a really good time, but I love Ozzfest! It will always be the best in my eyes. I get to congregate with all the crazy metal heads like me. Austin is such a cool city, and they have so many different types of music and art. I'd love to live there one day. EOS It would be awesome if I could get out to Ozzfest some year. And if I could swing the cost of the flight, I'd love to go to Ragnarök someday. Have you ever attended Ozzfest when they were in Europe? EOS No, that would be the ultimate! I've heard of Ragnarök, but I've never heard of many of the bands that play there. It seems like a cool vibe though. I'd have to save for the entire year and not see any other concerts to have the funds to pay for the flight. EOS I know, right? Lol - I'm signing up for a competition to win a trip to Iceland. The runners up will get free Vodka. You should enter too, and if we get lucky we can split the vodka even if neither of us wins the big prize! EOS How do I enter? I'm all about getting some free booze or a trip to Iceland! Maybe I'd get to meet HAM! That would make my day to meet the legends in real life. EOS It's on some Atlas Obscura page - Win a trip to the Land of Fire and Ice. Yeah, Iceland has really had an outsized impact on the music world for such a tiny country. Do you like any other Icelandic artists? EOS Of course, you gotta love Misþyrming! A live show might be traumatizing though, lol. They get all gory and bloody on stage. I've only seen YouTube videos though. EOS Wow, yeah that sounds a little out of my range. I like Sigur Rós actually, especially their older stuff. Super chill. EOS Sigur Rós is good for some relaxing or getting busy between the sheets. Portis Head is good for that too. You get that sultry voice, jazzy riffs, and the theremin that sounds so cool. EOS Yeah I love Portishead, really great stuff. What other English bands are you into? EOS I don't know about British bands, but I like Björk and Muse when I'm feeling less intense EOS Muse is good, but Bjork is a bit beyond me. Did you ever see her act though? She's really compelling.

It showcased the best of what we loved about her on American Idol (a show she helped define with her first-season win), her emotional intensity and her range — heard here across two octaves, from a low G3 to a high G5. And it infused mainstream music with a new energy desperately lacking in an era dominated by auto-tune and manufactured pop. Clarkson’s furious euphoria reflected both the rage and relief that comes at the height of a complicated breakup. It’s an honest emotional dump, not trying to be cool or mature: She’s pissed and she’s sad and she’s free and she’s so moving on. With anthemic force, Clarkson managed once again to unify Americans across the country — because who didn’t shout along to that hook at least once?", "Response": "Since you've been gone is a really good song, with a lot of meaning behind it.

Known as the Agoge, the system emphasized duty, discipline and endurance. Although Spartan women were not active in the military, they were educated and enjoyed more status and freedom than other Greek women. Because Spartan men were professional soldiers, all manual labor was done by a slave class, the Helots. Despite their military prowess, the Spartans’ dominance was short-lived: In 371 B.C., they were defeated by Thebes at the Battle of Leuctra, and their empire went into a long period of decline.", "Response": "Spartan boys were trained at the age of 7, don't you think that's a bit too young?"}

The philosophy asserts that virtue (such as wisdom) is happiness and judgment should be based on behavior, rather than words. That we don’t control and cannot rely on external events, only ourselves and our responses. Stoicism has just a few central teachings. It sets out to remind us of how unpredictable the world can be. How brief our moment of life is. How to be steadfast, and strong, and in control of yourself. And finally, that the source of our dissatisfaction lies in our impulsive dependency on our reflexive senses rather than logic.", "Response": "I have heard about Stoicism in philosophy class, how its teachings show us that the world can be unpredictable and how short of a life we life on Earth.

Getting To Know The Roman Emperor And for Marcus, Stoicism provided a framework for dealing with the stresses of daily life as a leader of one of the most powerful empires in human history. It is not surprising that he wrote his Meditations in the last decade of his life, while on campaigning against foreign invaders. Passed down from his mentors and teachers, Marcus embraced the studies of Stoicism which we see in him thanking his teacher Rusticus for introducing him to Stoicism and Epictetus inside Meditations. Another influence on Marcus came from Heraclitus, whose concepts we can see throughout Meditations and who had a strong influence on Stoic thought. Given the literary world at the time, Marcus was mostly likely not exposed to Seneca, another one of the three most prominent Stoics. What is tragic about Marcus, as one scholar wrote, is how his “philosophy—which is about self-restraint, duty, and respect for others—was so abjectly abandoned by the imperial line he anointed on his death.”", "Response": "I have, he was a very well known Roman Emperor and was very well known for being a power leader during his time. However, I did not know that he was a stoic. It seems that Stoicism goes way back to ancient times."}

He grew up during the golden age of Pericles’ Athens, served with distinction as a soldier, but became best known as a questioner of everything and everyone. His style of teaching—immortalized as the Socratic Method—involved not conveying knowledge but rather asking question after clarifying question until his students arrived at their own understanding. He wrote nothing himself, so all that is known about him is filtered through the writings of a few contemporaries and followers, most of all, his student Plato. He was accused of corrupting the youth of Athens and sentenced to death. Choosing not to flee, he spent his final days in the company of his friends before drinking the executioner’s cup of poisonous hemlock. Socrates was born and lived nearly his entire life in Athens. His father Sophroniscus was a stonemason and his mother, Phaenarete, was a midwife. As a youth, he showed an appetite for learning. Plato describes him eagerly acquiring the writings of the leading contemporary philosopher Anaxagoras and says he was taught rhetoric by Aspasia, the talented mistress of the great Athenian leader Pericles.", "Response": "it seems that Socrates legacies of such a way of thinking about life still continues.

I thought the first two-thirds of Seveneves were really interesting. I even enjoyed The Rise and Fall of DODO which he only co-wrote. This one is more, and less, cerebral than some of his other works. It is doing an admirable job of providing a spec-fic story focusing on the “Mind-Body problem”. But I’m just not down with this story. I think it is because I hate the idea that if a computer can simulate my personality it is somehow actually “me”. I just don’t believe that.

Basically this involved producing a lot of Mathematica notebooks.

With 14 Emmy Awards and an audience of over 100 million viewers, the TV show M*A*S*H helped the nation come to grips with the harsh and occasionally hilarious realities of war. Mobile Army Surgical Hospital 4077 was fictional, but the wisecracking main character Hawkeye Pierce was based on a real person: H. Richard Hornberger. But though the former U.S. Army Surgeon penned the book that led to the series—and was as heroic and humorous as Hawkeye himself—he came to hate TV’s take on his own creation. Hornberger barely profited from the show—he only got $500 per episode, and sold the rights to the franchise for pennies. But his bitterness was more than financial. As the show’s reputation for its commentary on war grew, he distanced himself more and more from the series, and the character he modeled on his own wartime heroism and humor.", "Response": "These shows are fictional, but at least one, MASH, is based on part of the real life of a surgeon named Richard Hornberger.

Together with his former student Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul), White turns to a life of crime by producing and selling crystallized methamphetamine to secure his family s financial future before he dies, while navigating the dangers of the criminal underworld. The title comes from the Southern colloquialism  breaking bad  which means to turn to a life of immorality or crime.[8] Gilligan characterized the series as showing Walter s transformation from a soft-spoken Mr. Chips into Scarface.", "Response": "I think Breaking Bad is the front runner, the story behind Walter and Jesse is incredible and captivating, especially with seeing the lung cancer story played out."}

Miraculously, Bryan Cranston ended up nailing the throw on the first take, and thus, Breaking Bad‘s instantly iconic pizza moment was born.", "Response": "The pizza scene where Walter throws pizza onto his home, I heard they had stacks and stacks of pizzas to be used for takes, but it only took Walter one throw to land it."}

(As someone who eats a lot of Oreos, trust me here.) And because I like nothing more than to watch the world burn, I decided to rank every Oreo variation I could find. And even with excluding Oreo Thins, Double-Stuf, and novelty off-shoots like Oreo Churros that are more variations on a theme than they are flavors, that left 55-odd different Oreos to pit against each other. 25.

These are delicious, and I could probably eat the whole bag (which, it should be noted, contains only 20 cookies) by myself. The super-sweet smell hits first, and it pretty much nails birthday-cake frosting. (I guess that’s not too different than the usual Oreo cream, but sweeter and somehow more yellow-smelling. No, I’m not on drugs.) The wafer seems slightly harder and crunchier than a standard Oreo, perhaps because they’re imprinted with “Oreo 100” and thus don’t have the same crinkly texture as normal Oreos. The filling has little sprinkles in it, though they’re really just for show—they don’t crunch or offer any flavor that I can detect. But they do visually communicate “THIS IS A BIRTHDAY CAKE! HAVE SOME FUN, ASSHOLE!” • “This Oreo tastes a lot like being stoned. Get stoned, open the fridge, find the frosting, shove something chocolatey in the frosting, and consume. Delicious.” • “They somehow taste even more artificial than original Oreos, which isn’t aided by the crunchiness of the sprinkles in the cream. They even smell artificial.” • “All they did was make me want a funfetti cupcake, which would be far better than this.”", "Response": "That's a good one too. The sprinkles look like they'll crunch in your mouth but then they don't. Opposite of Firework. If you had to pick a favorite what would it be?"}

Chinese consumers liked the contrast between the bitter cookie and the sugary cream, but,  they said it was a little bit too sweet and a little bit too bitter,  Davis explained. Kraft changed the recipe and made the cookie more chocolatey. The cream less cloying. So they said this is a better balance,  Davis said. And it started to sell. But once the Kraft team began to tinker with the classic features of an Oreo, why not go all the way?", "Response": "So you lie the sweet! It can be too much sometimes. In China they had to alter the recipie to make it less sweet."}

It was his first, so he hadn’t quite learned his craft very well. Joe Dante’s original film had some gore, some subversiveness, and Z-grade horror corniness. This film has none of that. First of all, the piranha are incredibly fake and fly around at one point. Second of all, the victims are on such scantily-clad display that the entire film feels like a skin flick. Knowing the titan that James Cameron will become in the industry, it is astonishing that he was behind the camera with this film.

All of the trouble, it seems, was worth it. What Cameron delivered was an epic that recalled Hollywood’s golden age as much as it did the action-packed thrillers that the director was better known for making. “Everyone thought they were going to lose money,” he remembered years later. “Nobody was playing for the upside, myself included.” Yet the film went on to become a record-breaking sensation, grossing more than $2 billion worldwide. Titanic was something audiences hadn’t experienced before: an extravaganza of visual effects and high-octane action, crossed with a romance so broad and appealing it seemed ripped from a dime-store novel. But more than that, Cameron had brilliantly taken the true-life tale of the most famous shipwreck in the world, inserted a tragic star-crossed couple—the soulful artist Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio) and the society girl Rose (Kate Winslet)—and yet somehow managed to give his film a happy ending.", "Response": "I think that even though the story line is incredibly sad, the film captured the beauty of what happened and the relationships.

The car crashed into a concrete lamppost and two trees on Hercules Street, in a 45 miles per hour (72 km/h) speed zone near Kelly Johnson Parkway in Valencia, Santa Clarita, California, after which the vehicle burst into flames. The crash was caught on film by a security camera.[1][2][3][4][5] Authorities determined that Rodas was driving the car while Walker was the passenger.[6] The Los Angeles County Sheriff s Department declared both victims dead at the scene.[3][7] Rodas died of multiple traumatic injuries while Walker died from the combined effects of traumatic and thermal trauma, according to the Los Angeles County Coroner s office. Both of their bodies were burned beyond recognition.[6] The curve where Walker and Rodas were killed is a popular spot for drifting cars.[8] The coroner s report stated that the 2005 Porsche Carrera GT was traveling at a speed possibly as high as 100 miles per hour (160 km/h) before the crash. The coroner s report further stated that no alcohol or other drugs were found in the systems of either man.[9] Furthermore, it states that there were no hints of technical problems with the car and neither a damaged surface of the street nor parts on the street played a role in the accident.[10] Police investigated as to whether drag racing played a role but were unable to find evidence of a second car s involvement.[11] A piece of the car was stolen off the tow truck as the wreckage was towed away on a flatbed. Two men, Jameson Brooks Witty and Anthony Janow,[12] were arrested for grand theft.[13] Walker s autopsy showed  scant soot  in his Vertebrate trachea, leading investigators to believe he died before the car was engulfed in fire, where Rodas was killed on or shortly after impact by head, neck, and chest trauma.[12][14]", "Response": "Paul Walker was in the first movie wasn't he?

The only other Linkin Park member to get a credit on it is guitarist Brad Delson, who co-wrote “Make It Up as I Go” and “Running From My Shadow.” Shinoda instead looked outside of his regular circle for collaborators. In addition to Moreno, “Blood in the Cut” hit maker K.Flay guested on a track, as did Machine Gun Kelly and Blackbear. “I feel like I’ve gotten to a new level as a songwriter in the last couple of years,” he says. “I don’t mean that like, ‘If you want me to write you a hit, I’ll write you a hit, kid.’ I mean I know I have a ton of different ways of approaching a song. For the most part, I’ve always written by myself and bring it to the band. It was rare that I would sit with all the guys and make something. That just wasn’t where the best ideas came from. On a little bit of [Linkin Park’s 2014 LP] The Hunting Party and most of [2017’s] One More Light, we did a ton of sessions with other songwriters and I got an education on how other people write.

In particular, Mose’s little sideplot was an easy highlight, primarily because it actually had both a collection of funny scenes and an evolving narrative.

When it was revealed that he had lined up the cars to jump over them on his scooter, it was a wonderful realization, and from his failed ride and eventual run across the cars emerged a really funny bit that had been built beautifully by the scenes that came before it. Michael Schur is obviously busy with this show s lead-in, but I would love a web series that’s just Mose going out on adventures, as the almost silent film quality to those sequences had more subtlety than the rest of the episode combined.", "Response": "I liked the \"Garden Party\" episode with Mose as the valet.

A rep for 20th Century Fox TV said cancellation decisions are made by ABC. \"This was a scheduling decision,\" wrote Jori Arancio, senior vice president of ABC Entertainment and ABC Studios. ABC and its production partner for the show, 20th Century Fox TV, typically negotiate licensing fees prior to each season; however, the network decided to cancel the show without doing so. Also, the contract between 20th Century Fox Television and ABC for the show, in which 20th Century Fox Television covered the cost of production, had expired after six seasons. Had the series been renewed for a seventh season, ABC would have been required to pick up \"Last Man Standing\"s production costs, which the network was unwilling to do. On May 20, 2017, Howard Kurtzman, president of 20th Century Fox Television, reportedly showed some interest in his studio continuing to produce the show. \"We're starting to explore that,\" Kurtzman said. \"...[Fox Co-President] Jonnie [Davis] and I are hopeful that we can find another home for it.\" \"Variety\" also confirmed in an exclusive report that 20th Century Fox Television would shop the series to other networks and streaming services in hopes it would be picked up for a seventh season; another home has not yet been found, however.", "Response": "Oh, you're right.

EOS Since you are leaving in a month, I highly recommend you view the most up to date information then as conditions change fast. EOS How many waterfall hikes are there within the park?", "Knowledge": "Waterfalls in Rocky Mountain National Park Rocky Mountain National Park in Colorado lies between the towns of Estes Park and Grand Lake, covering over 260,000 acres of mountainous terrain. With more than 470 miles of streams and lakes, many of which tumble through the mountains, the park has numerous waterfalls guests can explore. The trails to these falls range from strenuous hikes to short walks, providing guests of all ability levels the chance to see their beauty. The easy 0.3-mile hike to Adams Falls starts at the East Inlet trailhead on the park’s west side. Guests find the East Inlet trailhead near the town of Grand Lake off West Portal Road, just outside of the park. Because the trailhead is outside the park’s entrance, guests may visit Adams Falls without paying the entrance fee. The left-hand side of the trail’s fork leads to the Adams Falls overlook. Colorado Hiking Vacations recommends visiting in the morning when the small overlook draws fewer crowds. The hike takes approximately 15 minutes. The National Park Service indicates that the Alberta Falls hike is one of the park’s most popular hiking choices. Guests enter the trail at the Glacier Gorge Junction trailhead and hike for 0.6 miles on easy terrain to see the Glacier Creek thundering over rock ledges. Because of its popularity, this hike draws large crowds, and morning offers the best chance to visit without too many other park guests. To access the trailhead, enter the park at Beaver Meadows, turn left on Bear Lake Road, following it 8.5 miles to a large parking area, which serves as parking for the trailhead. Calypso Cascades, a lesser-known waterfall in the park, sits along the path to the better-known Ouzel Falls. This tree-lined falls has several rocky ledges, creating a pleasing sound and image. To access the falls, enter the park at the Wild Basin Lodge entrance. Follow the dirt road to the end, which has a small parking lot near the Wild Basin Ranger Station. The moderate hike takes approximately one hour to hike one way. Along the 1.8 miles to Calypso Cascades, hikers can take a short detour to see the small Copeland Falls. Ouzel Falls sits 0.9 miles past the Calypso Cascades on the same hike, with its trailhead near the Wild Basin Ranger Station. The National Park Service states that falls’ name comes from the ouzel bird, which regularly plunges into the stream above and below the falls in search of fish, providing entertainment for those who venture on the moderate hike. Colorado Hiking Vacations indicates the trip to Ouzel Falls takes approximately 1 1/2 hours one way. The 2.7-mile moderate hike to Fern Falls starts at the Fern Lake trailhead, which is near the Moraine Park campground. Hikers follow the trail along the Big Thompson River until they reach The Pool, which they cross on a log bridge. A fork in the road just after the bridge takes hikers either to Fern Falls or Cub Lake, with the right fork heading to the falls. Those looking for a challenging, but short waterfall hike choose the 0.3-mile hike to Chasm Falls. Colorado Hiking Vacations indicates that it takes just two to three minutes to reach the falls. To visit Chasm Falls, enter the park from the Fall River entrance, following the road to Sheep Lakes. Just after the lakes, turn onto Old Fall River Road, driving to a sign for Chasm Falls and a small parking area. Since Old Fall River Road allows only one-way traffic and the parking lot holds only 15 cars, guests should visit early in the day to get a parking spot and the opportunity to visit the falls. If the parking area has no openings, guests must keep driving. Cascade Falls, accessed through the North Inlet trailhead on the park’s west side near Grand Lake, offers hikers a 3.5-mile hike over easy to moderate terrain to a thundering waterfall. The falls, while not as tall as others in the park, has several rocks and ledges, making it quite noisy. The hike takes approximately 1 hour and 20 minutes, according to Colorado Hiking Vacations, and has restroom facilities available along the way. Experienced hikers often choose the four-mile hike to Timberline Falls along Loch Vale. The beginning of the hike is deceptively easy, but toward the end, hikers must navigate stone steps, cross a creek that has no bridge and climb a few steep grades to get close to the falls. Access the hike from the Glacier Gorge Junction trailhead. Along the way the trail passes Alberta Falls. After Alberta Falls, follow signs to Mills Lake. After viewing the lake, follow the Sky Pond signs to reach the falls. Those who wish to view Rocky Mountain National Park waterfalls without the need to hike long distances appreciate the short two- to three-minute walk to Horseshoe Falls. The falls drop over a rock-strewn hillside, bending in a slight horseshoe pattern. The open area and mountain backdrop offer excellent photographic opportunities. Park guests traveling Old Fall River Road spot the falls from the road. A parking area just past them serves as the trailhead for the Alluvial Fan trail, which takes guests to a bridge overlooking the falls.

The process begins by collecting clear bottles (the easiest to dye) from the ocean which get shipped to China where they undergo an intense cleaning. From there, it s melted down and made into filaments which get transformed into polyester, resulting in an eco-friendly pair of boardshorts that helped clean the ocean you re swimming in. Girlfriend Collective is an athleisure brand known for their colorful, comfy leggings made from 25 recycled bottles. The process starts with all of the consumer waste or plastic being sorted at the plant, chemically cleaned, shredded into tiny bits, and then shipped to a manufacturing facility where it s turned into fabric. KARUN believes  nature is the greatest teacher and inventor  and as such, has found a way to create a positive impact on the planet by making their 7 Seas Sunglasses out of reclaimed fishing nets from the ocean. When they re not making shades that would put Warby Parker to shame, they re caring for the land by using wood from fallen Chilean oak trees to produce their stunning Wood Collection or working with leather waste and cotton from Patagonia to create the straps for their glasses. The UK’s GANT is trying to tackle ocean pollution with the launch of their own Beacons Project where they have teamed up with Mediterranean fisherman in hopes of removing plastic waste from the ocean. It’s the perfect incentive for the fisherman as they’re already catching the stuff as is—so instead of tossing it back into the deep, the plastic upcycled to produce yarn that s eventually woven into their button-down shirts.", "Response": "There are several companies like Adidas that are recycling ocean plastic for clothes and home goods.

{"Context": "My favorite music band is Nine Inch Nails. I have a tattoo of the lead singer on my arm EOS I love the cover art of the With Teeth album", "Knowledge": "The lyrics to “Hurt” are a major point of contention between fans and admirers of Nine Inch Nails — two major themes divide the group: one leaning towards coming back from drug addiction and reflecting on the experience, and the other ending the concept behind The Downward Spiral, where the main character, who attempted suicide in the previous track, survives and realizes that this coping strategy was completely pointless, and that he can still fix everything he has caused. He also discusses herein the so-called legacy he has tried to make; the “empire of dirt.” Industrial rock band Nine Inch Nails (abbreviated as NIN and stylized as NIИ) was formed in 1988 by Trent Reznor in Cleveland, Ohio. Reznor has served as the main producer, singer, songwriter, instrumentalist, and sole member of Nine Inch Nails for 28 years. This changed in December 2016 when Atticus Ross officially became the second member of the band. Nine Inch Nails straddles a wide range of many styles of rock music and other genres that require an electronic sound, which can often cause drastic changes in sound from album to album. However NIN albums in general have many identifiable characteristics in common, such as recurring leitmotifs, chromatic melodies, dissonance, terraced dynamics and common lyrical themes. Nine Inch Nails is most famously known for the melding of industrial elements with pop sensibilities in their first albums. This move was considered instrumental in bringing the industrial genre as a whole into the mainstream, although genre purists and Trent Reznor alike have refused to identify NIN as an industrial band.", "Response": "NIN is a great band!

Doubleday was still at West Point in 1839, and he never claimed to have anything to do with baseball. In 1907, a special commission created by the sporting goods magnate and former major league player A.J. Spalding used flimsy evidence—namely the claims of one man, mining engineer Abner Graves—to come up with the Doubleday origin story. Cooperstown businessmen and major league officials would rely on the myth’s enduring power in the 1930s, when they established the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum in the village.", "Response": "Yeah it's crazy that the sport goes all the way back to the mid 18th Century isn't it!

I even cut corners for my own pieces if it means keeping everyone else from getting home hahah", "Knowledge": "OBJECTIVE: Be the first player to get all four your pawns from the color corresponding START space to HOME. MATERIALS: game board, 16 pawns (4 of each of the 4 colors), deck of cards (without 6’s or 9’s) TYPE OF GAME: Strategy Board Game AUDIENCE: Kids and adults Each player picks a color: choose the four corresponding pawns and place them at the start of the same color. Shuffle the deck of cards after removing the sixes and nines and place the deck face down on “Place Pack Here,” this is the draw pile. Pick a player to start the game (highest card draw, youngest player, etc.) Play moves to the left. Pawns move around board clockwise. To begin moving your pawns from the START you must draw from the deck either a 1 or a 2. If you draw a 1, move your pawn out of the start and place it on the space below marked with a circle. If you draw a 2, move pawn to the circle and draw again. These are the only cards that can start a pawn. If you do not draw either a 1 or 2, place card in the discard pile and you lose your turn. Pick cards by drawing the top card of the Draw Pile and moving, is possible, the respective amount of spaces. Dispose cards in the Discard Here Pile. Two pawns may not occupy the same space on the board therefore, pawns are allowed to jump and bump other pawns. If a pawn is located in your path, and you have sufficient number of moves, you may jump over that pawn. However, if you land on the same space as another pawn you can bump it back to it’s start. Two pawns of the same color are not premised to occupy the same space. If your move gives you no option other than landing on a space you already occupy, you lose your turn. Pawns may also move backwards if a 4 or a 10 card is drawn. If your pawn has been moved at least 2 spaces beyond your START, on your following turn you can move into your SAFETY ZONE without having to move across the board. Safety Zones resemble slide zones but are larger, at the end of which is HOME. You can only enter the Safety Zone which corresponds to the color of your pawns/START space. Normal rules apply within the Safety Zone. You may not enter the Safety Zone through a direct backwards move, however you can move backward out of the Safety Zone if the card instructs. That pawn has the opportunity to move back into the zone on the following turn. Sorry! Card Revenge Rules: How Do You Play Sorry! Card Revenge?", "Response": "Oh no! I'm sure everyone gets so angry. The best is when you know your pieces are in the safe zone while everyone else remains a target."}

Now, finally, at long last, that prediction seems likely to come true in 2019. We are on the brink of space tourism, and all of us wanna-be astronauts will actually have a chance to go to space. The question is: which of the space tourism companies should you book your (currently super-expensive) ticket with? We’ve previously discussed whether SpaceX counts as a space tourism company, but as of late 2018 it’s official: SpaceX has agreed to take Japanese entrepreneur and billionaire Yusaku Maezawa along with several artists on a trip around the moon. The target launch window is 2023; we’ll see how that timeline is adjusted as we get closer to launch. If you’re familiar with space, you already know that Roscosmos, Роскосмос, is the Russian Space Agency. In partnership with NASA, Roscosmos helps train and launch all astronauts to the International Space Station; they have done so since the end of the space shuttle program in 2011. They have also permitted Space Adventures to purchase seats aboard their Soyuz rockets for space tourists who pay to visit the ISS.

There’s been a murder in the Boddy Mansion and it’s up to you to find the culprit. There are only six suspects and you are one of them. Move your game pieces through the rooms and secret passageways of the mansion depicted on the game board to look for clues. Who murdered poor Mr. Boddy? What weapon was used? And where did the incident take place? The more clues you find, the more you will be able to narrow down the many possible answers to those questions.

The first official Monopoly game hit the market in 1935, and this game of buying property has been creating real estate titans ever since. The board game requires risk and luck, as players buy and trade properties and try to not get thrown in jail. If you have the funds, players are allowed to buy available properties. You can then make income during the game by charging the other players rent if they land on any of the spaces that you own. In order to win the game you have to bankrupt your opponents, which can take a while. The ideas is to buy enough property on the same part of the board that you create a monopoly and eventually the other players won’t be able to afford to pay your rent anymore. Scrabble is a beloved word game. It’s like a giant word jumble with endless possibilities. Players are given a set number of wooden letter tiles to begin, and each letter is assigned a different point value. You will immediately start analyzing your letter tiles to see what possible word combinations you might be able to create to play the most point-rich words. You’ll want pen and paper nearby to keep track of your scores, and you’ll also probably want a dictionary—it will come in handy when the validity of a word undoubtedly gets challenged. Once one player has used all his or her tiles the game ends and points are tallied, but whoever ends up with the most points is the real winner. Stratego is like a Napoleonic version of capture the flag. In this two-person game of military moves, players arrange all 40 of their game pieces in whatever order they choose. There are 12 different kinds of pieces, and each plays a different role that needs to be considered during setup. There are many layers of strategy involved in a successful setup, making this game as enjoyable for adults as it is for kiddos. Once all of the pieces have been arranged, game play commences as you make your way into enemy territory in an effort to locate your opponent’s flag. Tread carefully—there are bombs planted to throw you off track and spies doing recon for the enemy. The player to successfully capture the opposing army’s flag wins.", "Response": "Not entirely like Checkers, but you can try Clue, Monopoly, Scrabble and Stratego.

The crew of 10 escaped, with two of them suffering serious injury and three suffering minor injury. While lined up on runway 21 awaiting takeoff, a puff of smoke was observed by a ground engineer from the vicinity of engine three which he conjectured could have been due to an overboost. The aircraft commenced its ground roll and after about 100 yards swung slightly to the left, which the commander (the handling pilot) corrected with the rudder and by reducing power to number 3 and 4 engines. Once corrected full power on all engines was resumed but the aircraft swung right. The commander applied corrective rudder and reduced power to number 1 and 2 engines, but this was not immediately effective and the aircraft left the runway before straightening, parallel to the runway. Knowing that the aircraft was capable of being operated from grass landing strips, the pilot opted to continue the take off; however, after 400–500 yards and at an airspeed of 90-95 mph the aircraft swung right and its course was obstructed by a tree which hit the left wing and a pile of gravel which hit the number 4 propeller. The aircraft yawed to the right and came to rest in a cornfield; the fuselage broke into two sections aft of the bomb bay and caught fire.<ref name=\"AAIB 11/89\">\"Boeing B17G Flying Fortress, F-BEEA 11-89 .\" \"Air Accident Investigation Branch\".

They&apos;re basic in the best way: cozy as a camp fire on the beach, never not wearable, and an integral part of menswear history. The humble gray crew neck sweatshirt helped Steve McQueen escape in The Great Escape, cemented John Travolta’s heartthrob status in Grease, and made Eddie Murphy a badass in Beverly Hills Cop. Paul Newman, the patron saint of laidback menswear, wore one. Today, a roster of famous stylish dudes trust in the gray crewneck sweatshirt (see: Ryans Gosling and Reynolds, Justin Theroux, Kanye West, A$AP Rocky, Michael B. Jordan). The allure is equal parts form and function, rugged vibes housed in a fitted cotton knit (like a perfect baguette, hard on the outside and soft as a cloud within).

{"Context": "My favorite athlete is Dennis Rodman. Dennis changed the rebounding game for the industry. EOS Dennis Rodman is my favorite basketball player of all time. I miss watching him play.", "Knowledge": "Alternative Titles: Dennis Keith Rodman, Worm Dennis Rodman, in full Dennis Keith Rodman, byname the Worm, (born May 13, 1961, Trenton, New Jersey, U.S.), American professional basketball player who was one of the most skilled rebounders, best defenders, and most outrageous characters in the history of the professional game. He was a key part of two National Basketball Association (NBA) championship teams with the Detroit Pistons (1989–90) and three with the Chicago Bulls (1996–98) and was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 2011. Rodman, who was 5 feet 11 inches (1.75 metres) tall when he graduated from high school in Dallas and who tried and failed to make the school basketball team four times, shot up more than another 7 inches (18 cm) and earned a spot on the Cooke County Junior College team in Dallas in 1981. A scholarship to play at Southeastern Oklahoma State University followed. Proving himself to be a prodigious collegiate rebounder, he was drafted in 1986 by the Pistons and was pivotal to the success of Detroit’s “Bad Boys” championship teams. In addition to being a tenacious defensive player (he was the NBA’s Defensive Player of the Year in 1989–90 and 1990–91 and was named seven times to the league’s All-Defensive team), Rodman became a ferocious rebounder. Although he was not an exceptional leaper, his timing, tenacity, and desire, combined with his ability to enrage opponents by holding, grabbing, and shoving, made Rodman one of the league’s top rebounders. He led the league in rebounds per game seven straight seasons (1991–92 to 1997–98), finishing with an astounding total of 11,954 in 14 seasons in the NBA. Following his tenure with the Pistons, Rodman played briefly with the San Antonio Spurs (1993–95) before moving on to the Bulls. It was during this period that Rodman—having already established a reputation for on-court temper tantrums and erratic off-court behaviour—became known for outlandish antics that made him a national celebrity. In addition to repeatedly defying the authority of coaches and league officials, Rodman turned his body into a gallery of tattoos, piercings, and ever-shifting day-glo hair colour; he also engaged in a wild partying lifestyle, famously dating popular music diva Madonna. He was later briefly married to Baywatch television actress Carmen Electra (his second marriage), and at one point, clad in a bride’s gown, he staged a wedding with himself. At times, when Rodman’s mood swings made his behaviour seem uncontrollable, even his admirers suspected a breakdown was near. The image most fans preferred for Rodman was as a Bad Boy, living on the edge. Rodman tried his hand at acting in motion pictures and at professional wrestling but was not particularly successful in either of these fields. As time passed, Rodman, the author or coauthor of three works of autobiography—As Bad as I Wanna Be (1996), Walk on the Wild Side (1997), and I Should Be Dead by Now (2005)—found himself increasingly less in the limelight that he seemed to crave. He did appear in a number of reality television programs, and in 2013 he courted publicity by traveling with a documentary crew to North Korea, where he became the first American to meet the country’s new leader, Kim Jong-Un, when the two attended an exhibition basketball game featuring members of the Harlem Globetrotters. The trip—a brainchild of, and bankrolled by, an American media company—drew a negative response from the U.S. government, and public reactions ranged from amusement to criticism of Rodman as someone naïvely allowing himself to be used by Kim in a bid for international attention. Rodman, DennisDennis Rodman (foreground, right) and Kim Jong-Eun watching an exhibition basketball game, P yŏngyang, North Korea, 2013. Jason Mojica—VICE Media/AP Images In the end, sociologists may have more to say about the life and times of Dennis Rodman than basketball buffs. Yet for all his charisma, controversy, bizarre behaviour, and off-court trips in and out of reality, two facts will stand out clearly amid the confusion surrounding Rodman’s NBA career. He was a great rebounder and an even more spectacular entertainer. When the final verdict on the Rodman enigma arrives, however, his strange, powerful personality will likely take precedence over mere statistics.", "Response": "What was your favorite part of his career?"}

Without further ado, let’s dive into Connor McDavid’s biography facts, childhood, career and personal life. Edmonton Oilers (2015–date) Born in Richmond, Canada, McDavid began skating at age of 3, before he began playing hockey at the age of 4. Kids were required to be 5 years or older before they could play hockey, but McDavid’s parents lied about his age. At age 6, McDavid enrolled in a hockey club in the nearby town of Aurora, after the hockey association in Newmarket, his hometown, will not permit him to play above his age group. At Aurora, a tender McDavid played against players as old as 9 years. McDavid went on to play for another Aurora team, the York-Simcoe Express. At York-Simcoe Express, while being coached by his father, McDavid helped the York-Simcoe Express claim four Ontario Minor Hockey Association championships.", "Response": "Connor started to skating at the age of 3, his legacy started basically in diapers.

The winter up there can be pretty brutal as well.", "Knowledge": "Here s a look at some of the best seasons by the NHL s 35-and-over crowd: Gordie Howe, 1968-69 (age 41) No athlete in the history of professional sports is comparable to Howe.  Mr. Hockey  was a great player when he was young and was still great when he old enough to be the father of some of his teammates. But his best NHL season, in terms of points, was in 1968-69. One day before his 41st birthday, Howe scored a goal in Detroit s 9-5 loss to Chicago (the Red Wings  76th of 78 games) to reach the 100-point mark for the first (and only) time in his NHL career. He s still the oldest player to reach triple digits in points. Howe finished that season with 103 points (44 goals, 59 assists). After two more seasons with the Wings, he went on to play six more in the World Hockey Association before returning to the NHL with Hartford in 1979-80 -- scoring 15 goals as a 51-year-old.", "Response": "I believe Gordie Howe played until he was 51?

A small rink is fairly easy to build if the conditions are right with consistently freezing temperatures in the winter. A DIY rink does require some natural snowfall before construction but once completed, it is relatively easy to maintain for the entire winter season. You can use wooden boards or PVC pipe to aid in the construction or go the truly no-cost approach by building it entirely out of snow and water. A backyard ice-skating rink depends on having a relatively flat, level site in your yard. Small dips and rises can be leveled out with snow before you pour the rink, but a very uneven or sloped lawn will not be very well suited to a skating rink.", "Response": "Was it easy to build rink? seems like many different elements have to be perfectly in place, like flat leveled yard, type of grass? wondering if weather, like snow, affects the building of a rink."}

That alarm is always going off at all hours of the night because ice time is so precious. 4 am practice is common.", "Knowledge": "As the youth hockey season comes to a close, I am reminded almost every day that this is the most chaotic time of year for hockey parents. It’s that crazy stretch where stress, anxiety, and the fear of unpredictability casts a dark shadow onto our sport at the youth levels. Parents are being lead to believe that the process to “Making It” begins younger and younger by the year. The professionalization of our sport has trickled down to even the youngest of levels, and parents are feeling the pressure to make the right decisions for their kids (where to play, who to play for, what level to play at) at way too young of an age. It’s especially hurting the parents who are struggling and feel like they have to keep up. They feel the need to pay an incredible amount of money to make sure their kids aren’t getting left behind. I had emails of families that pay $5,000. I had emails of families that pay upwards of $50,000. And while I don’t think it’s right to give an average annual cost, I would say that a sensible range would be about $10,000-$20,000 per year. If you are under $10k, you are probably playing a split season, in MN, younger, or are extremely lucky. If you are over $20k…you are probably traveling way too much.", "Response": "I agree with you, Hockey is not a cheap sport to support either, between practices and gear, seems there is a hefty but worthy price. I am sure your parents are so proud of you!"}

Cast as an inmate who begins a dangerous flirtation with his psychologist (played by Deborra-Lee Furness), Jackman won fans as attractive bad boy Kevin Jones. Jackman and Furness continued their relationship offscreen, and the two were married in 1996. That same year he took to the stage, scoring the lead in the Australian premiere of Andrew Lloyd Webber’s musical adaptation of Billy Wilder’s noir classic Sunset Boulevard.

They sure gave Alabama a run for their money back in the day. EOS Yes they did! Those were some exciting games with Alabama!", "Knowledge": "Florida's style of football came directly from Urban Meyer's offensive-minded philosophy of a fast-paced offense and defense, generally using smaller, quicker players. They run a form of the spread offense, using speed to spread the field, which results in quick drives and higher scoring games. The Gators use a basic 4-3 defense and again use speedy players to try to gain an advantage on their opponent. The 2009 SEC Championship Game was played on December 5, 2009, in the Georgia Dome in Atlanta, Georgia, to determine the 2009 football champion of the Southeastern Conference (SEC). The game featured the Florida Gators and the Alabama Crimson Tide. The Crimson Tide was the designated \"home team\"; this home team, chosen on an alternating basis, was 2–4 in SEC Championship Games. The winner was all but assured to go on to play for a National Championship, in a likely matchup with the Texas Longhorns provided Texas won in the Big 12 Championship Game versus the north division champion Nebraska Cornhuskers. Entering the 2009 contest, the SEC East was 11–6 in SEC Championship games, with the Florida Gators accounting for seven of the eleven victories. Before the 2009 game, Alabama represented the SEC West six times in the conference championship game, compiling a 2–4 record, and had faced the Gators in all six of their previous SEC Championship game appearances. This was the first and so far the only time any conference championship game had featured two undefeated teams and was also the first time an AP Poll No. 1 played a No. 2 outside of the BCS Championship Game since the top-ranked Ohio State beat the second-ranked Michigan during the 2006 regular season.", "Response": "Very much.  Meyer's fast paced offense and defense paired with Tebow being a running quarterback really put Alabama in a tough spot since they focus primarily on defense."}

Predictably—in part because it would’ve been so weird to celebrate the victory of one half of an incestuous couple—neither Daenerys’ dangerous zeal nor Jon Snow’s moral purity clinched the Iron Throne; Tyrion had a great mind, but his heart became too much of a liability. And if “Bran the Broken” seemed more likely to stare meaningfully into the middle distance for the rest of his days than play the straight-man boss in a workplace sitcom starring Tyrion and Bronn, well, at least he came closest to embodying a great leader as conceived by a titan of Western thought who isn’t George R.R. Martin. As you might remember from Philosophy 101, Plato’s utopia was presided over by philosopher kings—rulers who loved knowledge more than power. It didn’t have to be this way. In its heyday, Game of Thrones was a political thriller more than a fantasy epic. Its struggle between would-be monarchs had depth because it was also a struggle between conflicting ideas about freedom, justice and leadership. Do good ends justify cruel means? Or should we, like Ned Stark, feel obligated to do the right thing even when it’s suicidal? When someone wrongs you, do you turn the other cheek or do you add their name to the kill list? Can any person be trusted with absolute power? It would’ve been nice if the show had followed these quandaries through to the end. To its credit, the finale devoted more time to political debates than most episodes in the past three seasons. Mad Dany was struck down because she believed so deeply in the righteousness of her crusade against tyrants and masters that she no longer valued human life. (But wasn’t it kind of unsettling to watch Jon and Tyrion lament her fixation on freeing slaves to an extent that implied any sane monarchs could countenance some amount of slavery?) Drogon took up the anti-fascist position, directing his fire at the seat of power. Toward the end, when the Houses gathered to name a new leader, Samwell Tarly got big laughs with his wild plan for universal suffrage—a reminder, perhaps, of how backward Westeros remains. And aside from being a nice gesture for fans disappointed by the derailing of Dany’s girl-power train, Sansa’s queendom in the North resonates as a vindication of a self-sacrificing worldview we might call Starkism; putting your own life on the line for the good of others should at least buy you liberty. (Sansa also got the best line of the episode: “Uncle, please sit.”)", "Response": "What was wrong with Game of Thrones in your opinion?"}

The more and more balls you hit, you’re trying to make compensations so that the golf swing will repeat and perform more consistently. You probably don’t know this is happening, but it is! The truth is, you’re not really getting better, you’re just hitting enough balls trying to find that elusive swing (compensation) that produces that ‘WOW’ golf shot where you think you’ve found the holy grail of golf.

But why stop there? You have other options at your disposal when trying to chase down extra yards, including the keys listed below. Master a great launch angle. The launch angle you use on your drives will have a lot to say about how far the ball winds up travelling in the end. To find a suitable launch angle, tee the ball high and place it near the front of your stance when swinging a driver. Too many golfers play with the ball back in their stance on the driver, which is a mistake that is going to lead to excessive backspin. You only want a moderate amount of backspin on your drives, as a high spin rate is going to lead to a ballooning ball flight and a loss of distance. Get comfortable hitting up on the ball through impact and you can reduce your spin rate while optimizing your launch angle.", "Response": "Stick with what works is good advice. For distance, you could try improving your chest turn and mastering a good launch angle."}

The film is set in the mid-22nd century, when humans are colonizing Pandora, a lush habitable moon of a gas giant in the Alpha Centauri star system, in order to mine the mineral unobtanium, a room-temperature superconductor. The expansion of the mining colony threatens the continued existence of a local tribe of Na'vi – a humanoid species indigenous to Pandora. The film's title refers to a genetically engineered Na'vi body with the mind of a remotely located human that is used to interact with the natives of Pandora. Development of \"Avatar\" began in 1994, when Cameron wrote an 80-page treatment for the film. Filming was supposed to take place after the completion of Cameron's 1997 film \"Titanic\", for a planned release in 1999, but, according to Cameron, the necessary technology was not yet available to achieve his vision of the film. Work on the language of the film's extraterrestrial beings began in 2005, and Cameron began developing the screenplay and fictional universe in early 2006. \"Avatar\" was officially budgeted at $237 million. Other estimates put the cost between $280 million and $310 million for production and at $150 million for promotion. The film made extensive use of new motion capture filming techniques, and was released for traditional viewing, 3D viewing (using the RealD 3D, Dolby 3D, XpanD 3D, and IMAX 3D formats), and for \"4D\" experiences in select South Korean theaters. The stereoscopic filmmaking was touted as a breakthrough in cinematic technology. In 1994, director James Cameron wrote an 80-page treatment for \"Avatar\", drawing inspiration from \"every single science fiction book\" he had read in his childhood as well as from adventure novels by Edgar Rice Burroughs and H. Rider Haggard. In , Cameron announced that after completing \"Titanic\", he would film \"Avatar\", which would make use of synthetic, or computer-generated, actors. The project would cost $100 million and involve at least six actors in leading roles \"who appear to be real but do not exist in the physical world\". Visual effects house Digital Domain, with whom Cameron has a partnership, joined the project, which was supposed to begin production in mid-1997 for a 1999 release. However, Cameron felt that the technology had not caught up with the story and vision that he intended to tell. He decided to concentrate on making documentaries and refining the technology for the next few years. It was revealed in a \"Bloomberg BusinessWeek\" cover story that 20th Century Fox had fronted $10 million to Cameron to film a proof-of-concept clip for \"Avatar\", which he showed to Fox executives in .", "Response": "The movie is complex by its own nature, by James Cameron's own making."}

(The title referred to the age at which she penned most of the tracks.) The recording debuted at number one on the British album chart, and critics praised Adele’s supple phrasing, her tasteful arrangements, and her ability to channel her intimate emotional experiences (especially with heartbreak) into songs that had wide resonance. She also earned comparisons to Amy Winehouse, another young British singer conspicuously influenced by soul music. (For many fans, however, Adele’s zaftig figure and down-to-earth persona made her the more-relatable star.) A performance on the television program Saturday Night Live helped introduce Adele to American audiences, and in early 2009 she won Grammy Awards for best new artist and best female pop vocal performance (for the lush bluesy song “Chasing Pavements”). Following successful throat surgery, Adele performed at the 2012 Grammy Awards ceremony. She also collected six Grammy trophies, including those for album, record, and song of the year (the latter two honoured “Rolling in the Deep”). Days later she received two Brit Awards (the British equivalent of the Grammys). The sales spike for 21 after both events further confirmed the singer’s emergence as a commercial juggernaut. In 2013 Adele won the Grammy for best pop solo performance for “Set Fire to the Rain,” from her concert album Live at the Royal Albert Hall (2011), and she picked up an Academy Award for the brassy theme song she provided for the blockbuster James Bond movie Skyfall (2012).

We were all very entertained by her being a mess. I was fucking sad about it, but if someone showed me a picture of her looking bad, I’d look at it.

First you should add at least one or two more classes that should change in numbers depending on the number of players and map size, one example is doctor the other is guard. You guys could also add 2 more maps, the original map can be considered as small and the second as medium and the third as big, a few map suggestions is a space station, or a mining outpost on an asteroid, also the size of maps add the number of players that can play such as 20 for big maps. A thing u can do to balance this is force the host to have 2 or more imposters on big or medium maps so u can balance the power. Finally can u guys please add a few more different tasks to crew mate and can u add a jail room to map cause I hate it when I get voted out even thought theirs a few of us left and we loss the game cause of me being voted out. so here’s how it could work if we think it’s someone but we not sure then we can send them to the jail cell where they have to wait until they are released in a certain time frame. I know u guys are very busy but I hope u guys can read this. Hope u guys take my suggestions and also Great game. Keep up the great work", "Response": "I'm a big fan of the original map.

If you are looking for something to play with your friends, among us is for you. A murder mystery game where one person on your ship is an alien in disguise, trying to kill the other crew mates. The crew must solve simple and cool puzzles to get the ship back in working order. While reacting to the “imposters” sabotages. And Trying not to become the imposters next meal. If a body is found or a player is suspicious of someone they can activate a meeting. (This is where a lot of the game takes place). They will talk and vote on the person they think the killer is. (Ps if you want to spam meetings or wait out the vote clock or be toxic in general you will usually be kicked). If the crew is right they win. If their wrong the game keeps going until only the imposter and one other unlucky person remain. You can still do tasks as a ghost and can go thru this to see the whole game unfold. This is very local multiplayer friendly with room codes to get your friends in and you can set the game to public after they join. It’s very active at the moment (you will get in a sever almost instantly). And as easy with online as it is with friends. Only problems I would say are that their are pay2play aspects as a another map costs money. That could make it repetitive. Overall great game and I highly recommend you get the bois online to try it. good luck❤️🗂🧡📝💚🔍💙🧮💜📐", "Response": "I'm not sure which number map it is in the series of maps they have released.

The track is quite enjoyable by itself but I never thought it would warrant a music video. Previous music videos from The Creator of Disco were quirky, unique, and well produced. While the story of the Devil’s debauchery in Hollywood is entertaining, it is an interesting, dark-themed video that contrasts Calvin Harris’ previous releases. Surprisingly, there is even a cameo by one of the stars of the “Elders React” Youtube series doing several lines of cocaine! PARENTAL DISCRETION IS ADVISED.

Taking from an unused idea they'd had for a \"Cheers\" episode, they conceived the idea of the psychiatrist working in a radio station surrounded by \"wacky, yet loveable\" characters. After realizing that such a setting resembled \"WKRP in Cincinnati\", the creators decided to emphasize Frasier's home life, which \"Cheers\" had rarely explored. Lee thought of his own experiences with \"the relationship between an aging father and the grown-up son he never understood\" and thought it would be a good theme for \"Frasier\". Although Frasier had mentioned on \"Cheers\" that his father, a research scientist, had died, it was decided to overlook the discrepancy (which they attempted to explain in a second-season episode). One element of the original concept that was carried over was the live-in health-care provider which would be for Frasier's father. Grammer points out that very little of the Frasier Crane of \"Cheers\" carried over to \"Frasier\", as his family history was changed, the setting, his job and even the character itself changed from its \"Cheers\" predecessor, having to be more grounded as the central character of the show so the other supporting characters could be more eccentric.", "Response": "The Seattle zoo is a nice zoo.

Robert Saleh is the new coach, he came from the 49ers", "Knowledge": "The Dallas Cowboys have Super Bowl talent, but the coaching staff just isn’t there yet. Jason Garrett is known throughout the profession as a professional and upstanding guy, but is he among the top-tier of NFL head coaches as a strategist? He’s not. That’s not his fault, he can only accomplish whatever his talent allows him to do. Ultimately, he didn’t put himself in this position, Jerry Jones did. Given that Jerry also is the most hands-on owner in the NFL, whatever results the Cowboys deliver, it’s on Jerry. Yesterday’s Cowboys loss in New England proves once again that generally speaking, superior talent does not always end up victorious. The NFL is highly dependent on competent coaching, and it was highly doubtful that Jason Garrett, offensive coordinator Kellen Moore, and defensive coordinator Kris Richard, were going to go in to Foxborough and win a game against Bill Belichick. Garrett and his staff put the Cowboys in a position to win the game, but could any observer of yesterday’s game genuinely say that the Cowboys ever had the game under control at any point? The Cowboys will win games where they have the talent edge and the opposing coaching staff is equal to or less competent than their own. Their record reflects this. What makes the 49ers defense so dangerous is the communication between the players, and that is a credit to defensive coordinator Robert Saleh. By now, the entire league is aware of the immense talent the 49ers possess on defense. However, what we see as the secret to their success is the communication between the players. It’s a defense where the players trust each other, and they know the scheme well enough to where they can self-correct, without any coaching intervention. That’s a high level of discipline, and it is a reflection on the coaching staff, and particularly defensive coordinator Robert Saleh. It looks to us as if he has entrusted cornerback Richard Sherman to control the back end, and linebacker Fred Warner to control the front end. HCR does not think Saleh is ready to be a head coach yet, but he certainly is a rising talent.", "Response": "How has he been doing in that position?"}

{"Context": "My favorite fashion brand is Nike. Nike can help you stand out EOS Nike is a famous, well known brand, they produced different types of clothing and trainers such Air Jordan IX Midnight Navy, Air Jordan XXXIII Red Black Sail EOS I think that Nike is better than Adidas", "Knowledge": "Home » News » 9 Reasons Why Nike Is Better Than adidas 1. Nike has the most dynamic logo on the planet. Although it was famously designed by then student Carolyn Davidson for a few bucks, the Swoosh is one of the best logos of all time. It’s simple, looks great on a shoe or anything else and suggests activity, arousal and victory at the same time – perfect for a sports brand. 2. Nike started with running. There’s no point in denying that the sneaker game has slowly shifted its focus to running, even in the US. And regardless of all that Jordan hype, Nike started out as a running company – and not just track-and-field running. Co-founder Bill Bowerman recognized the potential of “jogging” in the early ‘60s, and published a book with that title in 1966. His ideas led to the creation of a running shoe that would ultimately be named the “Cortez” in 1968. 3. Nike has Jordan. Despite its roots in running, Nike has been synonymous with basketball – and basketball is Jordan, to some extent. Together they formed the cornerstones for the rise of a global sneaker culture. Although adidas has had successful basketball shoes a decade before, it was his Airness who popularized sneakers as a fashion and style item. The Air Jordan 1 was also designed by Peter Moore, almost a decade before the same Peter Moore would design the “three bars logo” which is now synonymous with adidas Equipment. 4. Nike has Back to the Future. Nike’s use of this movie wasn’t just smart product placement but arguably the most brilliant and long-term marketing move of the millennium, spanning three decades in the rollout. First: presenting the Nike Bruin in part 1 in 1985 – in one of the most iconic pop-cultural movies ever. Second: Fictionally imagining how sneakers would evolve 30 years later in part 2 and introducing the Nike Mag. Third: actually releasing that shoe as predicted in the movie – finally with power-lacing and endorsement by Michael J. Fox – no other company even comes close. 5. Nike owns basketball. Not because of names like Michael Jordan, Lebron James or Kevin Durant but because the Swoosh owns the category – today. With a market share of 95% in the U.S. there’s no way around the fact, although adidas is making a lot of right moves at the moment. 6. Nike owns collaborations. Although you will find single collaborations from other companies dating back to the 1970s or even before, Nike invented the collab game as we know it. From late ‘90s releases like the Wu-Tang Clan X Nike Dunk High or all of the Stüssy collabs from the early 2000s up to the whole Nike SB program including all the Supreme Dunks – Nike got the ball rolling. 7. Nike invented limited edition retros. It’s hard to imagine but back in the days, a shoe was done when the next model came out. Thanks to a few east coast US retailers, Nike realized that there was a potential in retroing the Air Force 1 in a limited edition “color of the month” program. Watch the Air Force 1 documentary for the complete story. 8. Nike has the most famous designers. Even beyond the famous architect-turned-sneaker-designer Tinker Hatfield, there are other designers whose names have become synonymous with sneaker culture – like Bruce Kilgor (Air Force 1), Sergio Lozano (Air Max 95), Eric Avar (Air Foamposite One) or even Tinker’s own brother Tobie Hatfield (Nike Free). Fragment Design’s Hiroshi Fujiwara should also be mentioned because of his close ties with Nike. 9. Nike has the best ads in the archive. Marketing has always been Nike’s strong suit. Just look through their archive and relive the gems they’ve produced over the decades – from beautiful vintage running ads to the ever-so-classic “Bo Knows” campaign. This is brand-building at its best.", "Response": "Most people believe that Nike is better than Adidas. Nike has done many and more collaborations and has the most famous designers"}

Paid five million dollars each, Muhammad Ali and George Foreman are flown to Zaire (now The Democratic Republic of the Congo) to fight for the heavyweight title of the world. Only the brutal dictator Mobutu Sese Seko was willing to put up the money for the fight and Don King, the infamous fight promoter, was happy to do business. State violence hangs around the edges of the frame and the impending monsoon’s fill the air with heavy electricity. More than just a fight movie, this is a work of philosophy and poetry and a document of Muhammad Ali as an artist. The strength of When We Were Kings is the strength of Ali’s screen presence. While George Foreman is nothing to laugh at, this movie belongs to “The Greatest.” In Zaire, Ali was considered something of an icon and the people of the country all wanted him to win. They admired the way he stood up to the American military when he refused to be drafted in Vietnam, which cost him years of his fighting when it led him to be stripped of his title. Decades later his words still burn. “My conscience won’t let me go shoot my brother, or some darker people, or some poor hungry people in the mud for big powerful America,” he said. “And shoot them for what? They never called me nigger, they never lynched me, they didn’t put no dogs on me, they didn’t rob me of my nationality, rape and kill my mother and father. … Shoot them for what? How can I shoot them poor people? Just take me to jail.”", "Response": "That was a very interesting documentary.

The mid-engined layout brought with it five steel bulkheads, and this in the days before high-strength steel was put into strategic positions via the wizardry of computer simulation – a combination that today sees body-in-whites shed kilograms with each new generation. All the same, the MR2 weighed 977kg (split 44:56, front to rear), making it a bit of a fatty compared to contemporary hatchbacks but still commendably light bearing in mind its semi-exotic spec.", "Response": "Wow.

EOS fair enough maybe a trip to germany ive heard you can go as fast as you want on the auto bahn", "Knowledge": "The thing is, it s just a highway, like almost any you re familiar with. It s not a closed course or a race track with rubber tires stacked on the shoulders of the road. So anyone who lets the horses out to play and nears 200 miles per hour is risking not only their own life but also the lives of the poor suckers in the Citroens and Fiats in the next lane. A mistake at that speed is usually, well, pretty terrible. General speed limits in Germany are set by the federal government. All limits are multiples of 5 km/h. There are two default speed limits: 50 km/h (31 mph) inside built-up areas and 100 km/h (62 mph) outside built-up areas. While parts of the autobahns and many other freeway-style highways have posted limits up to 130 km/h (81 mph) based on accident experience, congestion and other factors, many rural sections have no general speed limit. The German Highway Code (Straßenverkehrsordnung) section on speed begins with the requirement [1] which may be rendered in English: Speed limits are enforced with a small tolerance. Driving merely 3 km/h (2 mph) or faster above the posted or implied speed limit is considered a punishable infraction in Germany. The speeding fines are set by federal law (Bußgeldkatalog, schedule of fines).[2]", "Response": "Yep high speed limit. can do up to 200 MPH on some stretches if you're brave enough - mostly up to 80 MPH but"}

The opera premiered in Paris, in 1875. The title character is a gypsy who entices the soldier José away from his girlfriend, only to leave him for the dashing bullfighter Escamillo. At the end of the opera, José kills Carmen in a jealous rage. The opera was initially unsuccessful, perhaps due to the stark verismo, or realistic portrayal of lower class and scandalous characters. Among the opera s most popular musical numbers is Carmen s  Habanera , which is based on a Cuban dance form and features a now-famous descending chromatic scale in the opening melody.", "Response": "I heard that it wasn't very popular because of its portrayal of the lower class."}

Pick of the bunch, at least in fame terms, is “Un Bel Di Vedremo,” which means “One good day, we will see.” This gets wheeled out by many a soprano for recital purposes but in context, right at the start of Act II, it’s as sad as it is beautiful. The tenor’s music is somewhat less subtle and in fact rather potently blunt. The first big number of the evening is the absolutely thriling tune “Dovunque al mondo,” or “Throughout the world.” It is built on top of “The Star Spangled Banner”, which you should be able to pick out fairly easily in the clip below.", "Response": "Yes I love that one.

But in the Final Fantasy world, Flan is a malevolent gelatinous creature, commonly served as a random enemy encounter. No word on its taste, but it’s probably safe to say no one is bringing this vicious villain to any company potlucks. Flan has been featured in just about every Final Fantasy game, and in earlier iterations, can go by any number of tasty names such as Jelly, Mousse, or Bavarois. Although they tend to be weaker creatures, they can become quite the hassle if your mages are out of MP. Flans are typically resistant to physical harm, rendering swords and daggers relatively useless. Still, they are often rather susceptible to magic and can be handily dealt with the right spell. A flan’s color commonly gives away their specific strengths and weaknesses.

EOS i think so too.  they are very sweet dogs.  it is all in how they are brought up.  what is your take on nature vs. nurture?", "Knowledge": "Is nature or nurture governing your dog s behavior? Studies suggest that a dog s behavior takes place as a result of genetic material (instinct) and experience (learning). The best way to differentiate the two is by asking the question: did the dog have to learn the behavior or was it innate (natural, therefore dictated by instincts)? A puppy typically does not need to learn to nurse once it is born. Nursing, therefore, is an innate behavior. Puppies are born with a strong suckling instinct and this is what helps the puppy survive. Another instinctive behavior as the puppy grows is the instinct to play. No puppy has to learn to play, it just happens. Nature instilled this hard-wired instinct in pups so they can play with other puppies and practice hunting skills necessary for survival. However, not everything the puppy does is dictated by instinct. The puppy s environment plays a role in allowing the puppy to learn new behaviors. For instance, upon playing with other puppies, the puppy learns that if it bites a playmate too hard, the puppy bitten will likely squeal in pain and withdraw from the game. With time, the biting puppy learns that in order to play, it must bite less hard. This is how puppies ultimately learn to inhibit their bite.", "Response": "I do think that nature s. nurture can play a huge part in how a dog behaves.

EOS Yes I have seen and watched them online.", "Knowledge": "In the world of professional video games, winning isn’t everything. Fortnite phenom Tyler “Ninja” Blevins made $17 million last year, enough for first place on Forbes’ inaugural ranking of top-earning gamers, but the 28-year-old pro won less than $100,000 competing. In fact, Ninja didn’t even qualify for the first-ever Fortnite World Cup, which was held in New York’s Arthur Ashe stadium last July, or its $3 million grand prize. (That money was won by Kyle “Bugha” Giersdorf, a 16-year old from Pennsylvania). That’s because top-earning gamers are more influencer than they are elite athlete. They earn their millions from leveraging their massive online followings into endorsements, fees and sponsorships. Ninja has 2.8 million followers on Mixer, Microsoft’s nascent gaming platform, which Forbes estimates will spend $30 million over three years after luring him from arch-rival Twitch last August. The blue-haired gamer has an additional 22.7 million YouTube subscribers and 14.9 million followers on Instagram. In all, the ten top-earning gamers have a combined 270 million followers across YouTube, Twitch and Mixer and earned $121 million last year. None of them made the list through competition alone. The next step? Mainstream celebrity. Ninja, who has been a pro gamer in one form or another since starting with Halo 3 in 2009, is well under way. His visage adorned soft drink cans thanks to an endorsement deal with Red Bull. Adidas has a Ninja sneaker. In the last year he has appeared on The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon, The Daily Show with Trevor Noah, and performed as a guest vocalist on Fox’s The Masked Singer. Ninja merchandise—from a graphic novel to his signature headband—can be purchased at Walmart and Target. And Ninja is just one of hundreds of internet entertainers cashing in on the growing influence of streaming and gaming culture, which has brands including Monster Energy, Postmates and State Farm paying up in their hunger to reach the elusive Millennial audience; eMarketer estimates sponsorships and advertising spends in gaming alone would hit $3.3 billion in 2019. The biggest streamers buttress that revenue by collecting directly from their followers, who can “tip” them with direct one-time payments or pay for a premium subscription that the players split with platforms like Amazon’s Twitch and Mixer. At his peak, Blevins made upwards of $500,000 per month, splitting the $4.99 premium fee fans paid to Twitch.", "Response": "I imagine it takes a lot of training! Which leagues do you follow?"}

There are few games I remember playing for the first time as vividly as Final Fantasy VII. After an opening cinematic that absolutely melted my brain, I watched slack-jawed as a soldier named Cloud and his Avalanche buddies leapt off a train and embarked on their grand adventure through Midgar and beyond.

This is a new weapon Facebook is using in the online information wars to thwart Facebook users who band together to flag a piece of content or a news publisher they disagree with to reduce the visibility of that content or publisher, Facebook says. It s part of a broader effort by the social media giant to go after malicious actors.  The Washington Post  first reported on the trust scores. • How do the trust scores work? Facebook sends news articles reported as false to third-party fact checkers to verify. Over the past year, it began using this trustworthiness rating to help judge the reliability of the person flagging the disputed news articles. If someone routinely falsely flags news articles later found to be accurate, it reduces their credibility the next time they dispute an article. If a Facebook user routinely accurately flags false news, that person s score improves. Other signals are used to evaluate users when they flag articles as false, but Facebook won t say what they are because it does not want people to game the system.", "Response": "Facebook has introduced a new trust score which has a thrid-party fact check articles that might contain false information.

Anything from paper, plastic and metal, to entire houses, almost anything can be recycled nowadays - and countries like Sweden have actually become so effective at recycling that it needs to import trash to keep its recycling plants going. Neighboring Norway is taking it a step further, and in 2015 inaugurated the world’s most effective fully automated solid waste recycling plant in village of Skedsmokorset outside of Oslo. Waste collection in Norway is based on a four-container system: a green bag for food waste, plastic and residual waste, another container for paper and cardboard, and a third for glass and metal packaging. Lastly, a red bin collects electronic and hazardous waste. Originally designed with a processing capacity of 30 tons per hour (tph), the Skedsmokorset plant has already undergone an expansion in October 2015 to increase its capacity to 40 tph. The plant’s automation system is so effective, that only two operating staff work in the plant to load the waste and remove the baled materials.

This is to help you decipher what type of waste goes where; there are green, blue and white bins in some areas and plain bins that take the specific green, blue and white bags in others. Plastic packaging goes into the blue bins, while paper and ‘restavfall’ (general waste) each go into the specifically marked white bins. At home, you need to have separate bins for different kinds of waste and each should have its own specific bag, so it’s easier for waste to be sorted afterward. The food and organic leftovers (anything that can be turned into compost, like food, dirt, leaves, small pieces of wood etc) should go in a green bag. All plastic packaging (anything from shampoo bottles to food packaging) should be rinsed thoroughly and go in a blue bag. General waste should go in any kind of bag you want, just make sure to only use the blue and green bags for their specific purposes – you will get them for free at any supermarket. The paper should be collected in a paper bag and disposed of in the appropriate bins. Recycling units in Norway Courtesy of Kildesortering i Oslo Plastic bottles and cans Once you’ve mastered the ‘green, blue and white’ process, it’s time to get acquainted with Norway’s pant system. Every plastic bottle of juice, water or soda, as well as every can of beer or soft drink, has a ‘pant’ value written on them. This value (usually around 1-2.5 NOK) is what you will have to pay in addition to its regular price when you buy a can of beer, for instance, however, you can get it back when you return the can to the pant machine. The pant machines are stationed in the entrance of all supermarkets; simply place your bottles and cans one by one on the slot, and the system calculates the pant value you get with each one. Once you’re done, the machine issues a receipt with the amount in NOK. You can use that to pay for goods at the supermarket, or you can donate it to charity via the machine.", "Response": "Norway has a really good recycling program, maybe you can look in to it for ideas if you haven't already."}

Philosophy Conversation EOS How do you feel about Alan Watts bringing eastern mystic knowledge to the west", "Knowledge": "Alan Watts Biography Alan Watts was a famous British philosopher known for his Zen teachings and interpretations of Eastern philosophy. Read more about this great philosopher in the following article. Founder/Co-Founder: The Alan Watts Electronic University Alan Watts was a well-known British philosopher, writer and speaker, best known for his interpretation of Eastern philosophy for Western audiences. Born to Christian parents in England, he developed interest in Buddhism while he was still a student at King’s School, Canterbury. Subsequently, he became a member of Buddhist Lodge, where he met many scholars and spiritual masters, who helped him to shape his ideas. He was a prolific writer and began writing at the age of fourteen. Many of his early works were published in the journal of the Lodge. At the age of twenty three, he migrated to the USA, where he first received training under Zen master, but left before he was ordained. He then studied Christian scriptures and functioned as a priest at Chicago for six years before leaving for San Francisco to pursue an academic career. Simultaneously, he started giving talks on Eastern philosophy and soon developed a wide audience both at home and abroad. Apart from writing more than 25 books, he has also left an audio library of nearly 400 talks, which are still in great demand. Alan Watts began his education at the kindergarten school of Saint Nicolas and then went to King s School in Canterbury. Apart from academics, the school also provided religious training under Muscular Christianity; but Alan found them rather grim. However, he excelled academically throughout the school years. While he was still a school student, he went on a trip to France with Francis Croshaw, a wealthy Epicurean who first aroused his interest in Buddhism. He then began to read about the religion and subsequently became a member of London Buddhist Lodge, now known as Buddhist Society. After finishing his general studies at the age of fifteen, he took up modern history, aiming for a scholarship at the Trinity College Oxford. He wanted to study philosophy, but there was no scope for that. He was also selected the senior prefect, Captain of his house. At the same time, he began spending his spare time at the Buddhist Society. Here he read widely on philosophy, history, psychology, psychiatry and Eastern wisdom. Although he received advices from Dimitrije Mitrinović and Christmas Humphreys, he was mostly self-educated.", "Response": "Philosophy is such an amazing concept. I am familiar with Alan Watts.

EOS Well not sure how similar it is to Westworld but it reminds me a bit of Man in the high castle which was good and dealt more with the concept of parallel worlds.", "Knowledge": "The Man in the High Castle  is a 2015 American dystopian alternate history television series produced by Amazon Studios, Scott Free, Headline Pictures and Electric Shepherd Productions. The series is based on the 1962 novel of the same name by American science fiction author Philip K. Dick. The story is an alternate history of the world in which the Axis powers won World War II. The United States and Canada has been partitioned into three parts - The Japanese puppet state of the Japanese Pacific States, which comprises the former United States west of the Rocky Mountains, a Nazi puppet state that comprises the eastern half of the former United States; and a Neutral Zone that acts as a buffer between the two areas, also referred to as the  Rocky Mountain States . As a whole, The Man in the High Castle is still worth recommending, but it’s a shame to see the show go out on its weakest season. The human drama is as strong as ever, but High Castle struggles to coalesce it into a coherent, impactful ending to its story. You’ll get series-best performances from Rufus Sewell, Joel de la Fuente, and Chelah Horsdal, but you’ll miss a more dynamic Juliana and the confidence the show had in its sci-fi DNA. In short, the final season is as splintered as High Castle’s own worlds, but if you relax your mind and let go, maybe you’ll be able to walk through with peace of mind.", "Response": "I have heard of that one, it's the one based on the alternate history where the Axis Power's won?"}
