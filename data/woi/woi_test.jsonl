These films are marketed towards children, but have the emotional depth and production quality to appeal to adults. Pixar’s key market differentiator is its focus on quality. Instead of throwing out a portfolio of movies every year and hoping that a few become blockbusters, Pixar makes big bets on a fewer number of films, producing one film every four to five years. It minimizes risk by ensuring the quality of these films via a highly monitored production process. Pixar has a very unique operating model compared to other film studios. In other studios, new creative teams are formed around new film concepts and then disbanded once the films are complete. Pixar takes a drastically different approach and retains creative talent as long-term employees. This allows teams to improve their skills and operating processes over time with increased repetition (3). Pixar leaders believe that the initial idea matters a lot less than the people who actually iterate and brainstorm around that idea throughout the production process (4). Other key elements of Pixar’s successful operating model include:", "Response": "You're right. The quality of all of Pixar's movies have increased over the years.

Probably because someone at Pixar thinks fat people are sad. Because they are fat. And how could they be fat and smile? Fat people have some nerve. Also, their poor vision is apparently causing them some distress. Joy doesn t wear glasses. She probably had Lasik. Because she is probably also rich. Rich, white (well, white-ish) people are also joyous. And she gets to wear a cute little dress, which she probably bought at Nordstrom, while Sad is shrouded in what is probably an itchy-ass thrifted wool sweater. Maybe that s why she s named Sad.

Then, after nearly three months of filming, director Andrei Konchalovsky was fired by producer Jon Peters in a dispute over the movie s ending, and was replaced with Albert Magnoli, who filmed all the chase and fight scenes in the ending. Reportedly, executive producer Peter MacDonald, who was also one of the film s second unit directors, took over directing the movie before Magnoli was brought in. A year earlier, MacDonald had to step in as director on Stallone s previous movie, Rambo III, after the original director was fired by Stallone. In his 1999 book of memoirs, Elevating Deception, Konchalovsky said that the reason he was fired was because he and Stallone wanted to give the film a more serious tone and make it more realistic than the producers wanted, especially Jon Peters, who kept pushing for the film to be goofier and campier, and as such, his relationship with Peters became untenable.[5]", "Response": "There were a lot of problems on the set, and Patrick Swayze was supposed to be Cash, left the project and went on to do Road House instead."}

EOS Awesome, I would suggest checking out Jimmy Eat World's 9th album. It's called Integrity Blues. EOS Oh, what's that album like?", "Knowledge": "Like a city skyline shimmering under a night sky, Jimmy Eat World s ninth LP, Integrity Blues, shines in the dark with glimmering production, a refreshed sense for hooks, and some new tricks to add to their catalog. After the less exciting Chase This Light and Invented, the quartet -- Jim Adkins, Rick Burch, Zach Lind, and Tom Linton -- resurrected some of their pop sense on 2013 s Damage, but a piece of the puzzle was still missing. On Integrity Blues, they strike a clean balance between past and present, almost as if they aimed to modernize Bleed American and Futures. Recorded in Los Angeles, it s easy to see how the city s nocturnal coolness could influence the Arizona band. Here, they sound more like Silversun Pickups and late-era Death Cab for Cutie than their fellow emo-rock survivors on the Warped circuit. It s a welcome update to their decades-old style.  Sure and Certain  and  Pretty Grids  sound plucked straight from Better Nature, while  Through  and  You with Me  are as effervescent as anything Ben Gibbard could conjure. Allusions to past works appear on  It Matters  (a throwback to  Cautioners ),  You Are Free,  and  The End Is Beautiful,  strumming at the same heartstrings of Bleed American s more yearning moments. Elsewhere, Integrity Blues distinguishes itself with new adventures in experimentation.  Pass the Baby  is the album s standout centerpiece, a three-in-one journey through atmospheric textures, an expansive release, and an unexpectedly heavy coda that ends up sounding, surprisingly, like Tom Morello playing on Nine Inch Nails  The Fragile. They haven t gone this hard since  Nothing Wrong  or  Get It Faster.  It s one of their best songs to date and the clearest example of the band s creative revitalization. The album closes in two parts on the title track and  Pol Roger,  which expand their sound with a horn section and orchestral string swell. It s as raw and vulnerable as the more morose numbers on Keane s Under the Iron Sea, evaporating into the atmosphere on an angelic chorus of  na na na s. Integrity Blues is Jimmy Eat World s most immediately accessible and focused album in years, a peak in the decades-old catalog of these reinvigorated and endearing stalwarts.", "Response": "It's an album that's really focused and quite endearing."}

Throughout its history, it has established itself as one of the leading cognac houses in its ability to innovate time and time again. During the nineteenth century, Hennessy pioneered the original VSOP cognac benchmark, after having been asked by King George IV to create a “very superior old Cognac”. It was also loved world-over in Russia and China, as French culture was transported to other worlds. Since Maurice Hennessy followed suit with the creation of the Extra Old (XO), Hennessy has since set the global standard for the classification of Cognacs. Now, the maison are in possession of the largest reserve of eaux-de-vie in the world, with approximately 350,000 casks. The master blenders have refined their techniques of blending through generations of heritage through the Fillioux family. Their goal now, is to continue innovating into the future by creating high quality blends popular with both young and older generations.", "Response": "I've always wanted to try a cognac since it has such an extensive history"}

I have to carry an epipen everywhere I go.", "Knowledge": "Allergy to peanut, which is often severe, is one of the most common food allergies in the United States. Although previous studies have shown that peanut oral immunotherapy (OIT) — ingesting small, controlled amounts of peanut protein —can desensitize adults and children and prevent life-threatening allergic reactions, the optimal duration and dose is unknown. In a study that followed participants after OIT successfully desensitized them to peanut, discontinuing OIT or continuing OIT at a reduced dose led to a decline in its protective effects. The study, published online today in The Lancet, also found that several blood tests administered before OIT could predict the success of therapy. The Phase 2 study—supported by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health—may inform who may benefit from peanut OIT and what changes in this experimental treatment should be implemented.", "Response": "Would you try a new medicine if it meant you weren't allergic to peanuts anymore?"}

But there are no tests to prove in advance that a GM crop is safe.[2] That s because people aren t usually allergic to a food until they have eaten it several times.  The only definitive test for allergies,  according to former FDA microbiologist Louis Pribyl,  is human consumption by affected peoples, which can have ethical considerations. [3] And it is the ethical considerations of feeding unlabeled, high-risk GM crops to unknowing consumers that has many people up in arms. Critics of GM foods often say that the US population is being used as guinea pigs in an experiment. But experiments have the benefit of controls and measurement. In this case, there is neither. GM food safety experts point out that even if a someone tried to collect data about allergic reactions to GM foods, they would not likely be successful.  The potential allergen is rarely identified. The number of allergy-related medical visits is not tabulated. Even repeated visits due to well-known allergens are not counted as part of any established surveillance system. [5] Indeed, after the Canadian government announced in 2002 that they would  keep a careful eye on the health of Canadians [6] to see if GM foods had any adverse reactions, they abandoned their plans within a year, saying that such a study was too difficult. The classical understanding of why a GM crop might create new allergies is that the imported genes produce a new protein, which has never before been present. The novel protein may trigger reactions. This was demonstrated in the mid 1990s when soybeans were outfitted with a gene from the Brazil nut. While the scientists had attempted to produce a healthier soybean, they ended up with a potentially deadly one. Blood tests from people who were allergic to Brazil nuts showed reactions to the beans.[7] It was fortunately never put on the market.", "Response": "It's a good theory.

Many of them report that when they go to Europe, they can eat bread without difficulties, but when they consume bread stateside, they have digestive-related symptoms. Why might this be? Around 60 percent of U.S. wheat production is of the hard red wheat variety; just 23 percent consists of soft wheat [source: Brester]. In Europe, the principal strains of wheat are generally of the soft variety. So what s the difference between the two? Part of the difference lies in gluten, a protein blend found in wheat and other grains. Hard wheat has more gluten than soft wheat, and the gluten it contains is stronger than gluten found in soft wheat. This tough gluten is ideal for baking soft, fluffy bread that people are used to consuming in the United States.", "Response": "I've heard that the most common strains of wheat in Europe have less gluten.

After the takeover, the company introduced its first model called ‘Rouge et Noir’in 1909 and later in 1910 it brought out ‘Meisterstück’ which gave the new name to the company. However, this pen name was first used in 1924. At present, the company makes other items besides pens a well and these include jewelry, leather goods, perfumes, watches, and eyewear, etc. In 1977, Dunhill acquired the company and after dropping the low priced pens and keeping the ‘luxury’ ones, it added other the other products described above to add to its luxury product line of pens.

I own a lot of stuffs from Tommy.", "Knowledge": "See Tommy Hilfiger Sunglasses Tommy Hilfiger eyeglasses were created by Tommy, who founded the company bearing his name in 1985, and the company has grown exponentially ever since. His style began with preppy sportswear for men, but later expanded into women’s clothing, eyewear, sunglasses, fragrances, and many other accessories. In the 1990’s the Tommy Hilfiger brand was one of the most prominent American brands, with a distinctive wardrobe of wearable, and comfortable clothing. Now, more than a quarter of a century later, the man who has written “I take tailored clothing and sportswear, the foundations of our collection, and put them in a blender to create something new and exciting,” continues to apply his beliefs to his brand. The Tommy Hilfiger eyeglasses collection manifests his philosophy. Hip hop artists became interested in the line, especially after Snoop Doggy Dogg wore a Tommy Hilfiger sweatshirt during his appearance on Saturday Night Live. Puffy and Coolio sported his designs, and his carpenter jeans became universally popular among his devotees. His clothing is often marketed with connections to the music industry, and he has sponsored many events through the years, such as Sheryl Crow, Britney Spears, and Lenny Kravitz. By the end of the 1990s, Tommy Hilfiger designs were being worn by preppies as well as hip hoppers.

Using $150 he'd saved from working at a petrol station as startup money, he oversaw the expansion of the company into a chain of ten stores. Despite meeting with initial success, People's Place filed for bankruptcy in 1977. In 1979 Hilfiger moved to New York City to pursue a career as a fashion designer, working on several different labels including Jordache Jeans. In the early 1980s he met Mohan Murjani, an Indian textile magnate hoping to launch a line of men’s clothing. With Murjani’s backing in 1985 Hilfiger debuted his first signature collection, which featured modernized versions of button-down shirts, chinos, and other classic preppy styles. The casual youthful attitude of these first designs would remain a trait of the Tommy Hilfiger Corporation's later collections. The new clothing line made its debut with a high-profile marketing campaign, which included a large billboard in Times Square by advertiser George Lois. The Tommy Hilfiger brand left Murjani International in 1989, with Silas Chou instead providing financial backing. That year Lawrence Stroll and Joel Horowitz, both former executives of Ralph Lauren, were hired as executives of the newly formed company Tommy Hilfiger, Inc., which had an initial focus on casual male sportswear.", "Response": "I'm not really familiar with the shoe collections.

Largely due to declining sales in the early 2000s, Hilfiger began reworking the brand, striving to retain the designer brand exclusivity of the Hilfiger label by signing a deal to distribute the best-selling Hilfiger lines at Macy's only. The Tommy Hilfiger Corporation continued to work closely with musicians into the 2000s, focusing on fragrances as well as clothes. Sweetface Fashion, which owns the J.Lo by Jennifer Lopez line, was bought out by Tommy Hilfiger in 2003. True Star, a fragrance endorsed by Hilfiger and released in 2004, featured Beyoncé as its poster girl.

Magnum: All of Derek Zoolander s signature looks—as well as many of the beloved characters from Zoolander—are returning for the much-anticipated sequel, Zoolander 2 (now in theaters!). And one of the greatest things about Zoolander was not only the silliness that made it a cult phenomenon, but the sheer amount of celebrities who were willing to make an appearance in the film in a multitude of ridiculous and hilarious ways. Some actors had yet to make a splash in Hollywood when they first appeared in the film (hello, Alexander Skarsgard!), while others were extremely established (like the late David Bowie s epic cameo). Nonetheless, every single celebrity sighting was pure perfection. And from the trailers alone (especially given Benedict Cumberbatch s look), it seems Zoolander 2 won t disappoint in the cameo department either. So to gear up for the sequel this weekend, let s take a look back at everyone who appeared in Zoolander. 1-4. Victoria Beckham, Emma Bunton, and Donald and Melania Trump 5. Tom Ford 6. Christian Slater 7. Cuba Gooding Jr. 8. Tommy Hilfiger 9. Fabio 10-12. Gwen Stefani, Gavin Rossdale, and Lenny Kravitz 13-15. Stephen Dorff, Sandra Bernhard, and Lukas Haas 16.

What else do you prefer from his collections, do you own any?", "Knowledge": "Hilfiger introduced his fresh take on the preppy look in 1985. Energetic and hyperbolic marketing campaigns would become a brand signature (some, over the years, have even argued that they were more creative than the clothes themselves). By the early ’90s, Hilfiger’s collections were evolving, incorporating the brighter palettes, blown-up logos, and loose, oversize forms synonymous with hip-hop style. Then Hilfiger did something few menswear designers had dared do before: use his success in that realm as a springboard for the womenswear runway. In 1996, he showed his first women’s collection. The New York Times was enthusiastic, cautioning other designers of all-American sportswear to watch their backs.", "Response": "I don't really know much about the collections, but it seems like there's a lot out there.

Beethoven dedicated the work to his friend Prince Karl von Lichnowsky.[1] Although commonly thought to be one of the few works to be named by the composer himself, it was actually named Grande sonate pathétique (to Beethoven s liking) by the publisher, who was impressed by the sonata s tragic sonorities.[2]", "Response": "I believe 1798 it was composed when he was 27 but formally release in 1799.

I wonder how Beethoven did it. It seems to me that he completely changed the trajectory of western classical music. I wonder what classical music would have become without him.", "Knowledge": "Coming out of a time of mind-boggling musical complexity of J.S. Bach, followed by the simple genius of Mozart, Haydn, and Gluck, the classical era’s version of pop music, Beethoven’s moody, and often dark orchestrations, were reflections of his deep emotional states, often times trying to communicate ideas, thoughts, and feelings, through instrumental music. Looking back to Beethoven’s symphonies, the titles he gave them reveal the weight of his emotions. No doubt, the political climate of the time, not to mention his own health struggles, least of all his rapid loss of hearing, The famous Symphony No. 5 is titled Fate. In No. 6 we have Pastoral. Even in his 9th Symphony, titled Choral, which was composed when he was almost completely deaf, one can’t help but be caught up in the incessant, madly skipping rhythm of the Molto Vivace, or the glorious, beauteous, dramatic finish of the Choral Finale (Ode to Joy). The genius, vision, and gifted talent of this classical giant is obvious.", "Response": "I agree. Especially when he was competing with Bach and Mozart. I feel the \"moody\" overtones of many of his pieces really demonstrated the depth of emotion that can be portrayed in a piece. I know it is a little cliche but moonlight sonata is my favorite even when the tempo is more uplifting the raw emotions are there. It makes me wonder how he was as a person"}

Sugerman began working as an assistant in the Doors office at the age of 13, and became their manager after Morrison died (replacing Bill Siddons).

She signed with the label Big Machine Records and became the youngest artist ever signed by the Sony/ATV Music publishing house. Her self-titled debut album in 2006 peaked at number five on the \"Billboard\" 200 and spent the most weeks on the chart in the 2000s. The album's third single, \"Our Song\", made her the youngest person to single-handedly write and perform a number-one song on the Hot Country Songs chart. Swift's second album, \"Fearless\", was released in 2008. Buoyed by the success of pop crossover singles \"Love Story\" and \"You Belong with Me\", \"Fearless\" became the best-selling album of 2009 in the United States. The album won four Grammy Awards, with Swift becoming the youngest Album of the Year winner. Swift was the sole writer of her 2010 album, \"Speak Now\". It debuted at number one in the United States and the single \"Mean\" won two Grammy Awards. Her fourth album, \"Red\" (2012), yielded the successful singles \"We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together\" and \"I Knew You Were Trouble\".

Its singles \"Shake It Off\", \"Blank Space\", and \"Bad Blood\" reached number one in the US, Australia, and Canada. The album received three Grammy Awards, and Swift became the first woman and fifth act overall to win Album of the Year twice. The 2015 concert tour for \"1989\" became one of the highest-grossing of the decade.

One of the few to survive, Pollard was given a second chance at captaining another whaler, the Two Brothers. But after 18 months in the Pacific, Pollard ran the Two Brothers aground, sinking the ship in what is now the Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument. The name of the whale was also inspired by real-life events.

This whale, killed off the coast of Chile near Mocha Island, was called Mocha Dick.", "Response": "Very cool. MobyDick was actually inspired by a few different true stories."}

After all, working out at 9 p.m. beats skipping it every single time because you slept through your alarm clock. But starting your day with a good sweat does have some serious advantages over leaving it for after work. Here are eight benefits of morning workouts that just might convince you to start exercising first thing. (Here are even more benefits of being a morning person, according to science.) It s logical to think that burning 500 calories in the morning could backfire by making you think you have a free pass to make up for the lost calories—and then some. But researchers from Brigham Young University found exercising in the morning can actually make food seem less appealing. For the study, published in the journal Medicine & Science in Sports & Exercise, researchers analyzed the brain activity of women as they looked at pictures of food and flowers, which served as the control. Women who d exercised for 45 minutes in the morning were less fired up about the tasty images than those who skipped the workout. What s more, the morning exercisers didn t consume more food than the other group over the course of the day. 2. You ll be more active all day long. Getting that morning workout in also inspires you to keep moving throughout the rest of the day. The Bringham Young University researchers also found in the same study that people who work out in the morning end up being more active in general.", "Response": "It's really what is best for you.  But if women workout early in the morning they seem less hungry.  Exercise in the morning also helps you be active more all day long and keep you motivated and moving the rest of the day."}

Ralph Lauren attended Baruch College in New York, but did not complete his degree in business, instead dropping out to sell men s wear. He later began to design his own neckties and men s clothes, and eventually added a women s wear line. He currently owns 35 boutique shops in the US. Lauren has accumulated his net worth largely through the extreme popularity of his various clothing brands, including most famously Polo Ralph Lauren. He was born Ralph Lifshitz, and changed his name due to his original name s unfortunate obscene connotations in English. Not, as some have alleged, to escape his Jewish identity. In his own words:  When I was a kid, the other kids would make a lot of fun of me. It was a tough name. That s why I decided to change it. Then people said,  Did you change your name because you don t want to be Jewish?  I said,  Absolutely not. That s not what it s about. My cousins who lived in California had changed their last name to Lawrence. So I just thought,  I m going to pick a nice last name —it wasn t particularly connected to anything or anyone.   What would become the world-famous Polo brand was first seen in a line of shirts Lauren designed for women in the early seventies. Lauren had the innovative idea to design the women s shirts in a style usually associated with men s clothing, and the line was a huge success. Now, Ralph Lauren is one of the most famous and successful fashion designers of all time.", "Response": "He has $8.2 billion net worth even though he didn't complete his degree."}

It would be so out of character for her music, especially for a genre like trap. Not all the tracks on Run could be technically classified as trap, but there are definitely a few that standout for their production value. “I Want U” has a dreamy intro that goes well with her falsetto signing before a much harder drop. There’s also “Naked” with Slumberjack, which provides great contrast against her voice as well.", "Response": "Her debut album is Run and she sings on most of the tracks, and there's some hip-hop type vibes as well.

LeBron has recently appeared in his eighth straight NBA Finals series. He has nine in total and now holds a record of 3-6. Jordan, as we all know, has six rings in six appearances. Often times, the rings argument is what puts MJ ahead of LeBron in debates on who is the GOAT. However, rings shouldn t carry that much weight. If they did, the greatest player ever would be Bill Russell, who won 11 championships in his 13-year career. Who is considered the GOAT of basketball is important because of the impact one player can have on the game. Unlike football, where 53 men play, basketball teams can be completely changed by one man.

Lucas’s success as a writer and director with American Graffiti (1973) gained him the backing of 20th Century Fox, which put up $9.5 million for the production of the first Star Wars film. The film, directed by Lucas, was in production for four years, with scenes shot in Tunisia and Death Valley, California, and on soundstages in England. When it was released on May 25, 1977, Star Wars (later retitled Star Wars: Episode IV—A New Hope) met with runaway success. A space opera set “a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away,” the film centres on Luke Skywalker (played by the then relatively unknown Mark Hamill), a young man who finds himself embroiled in an interplanetary war between an authoritarian empire and rebel forces. Skywalker and the opportunistic smuggler Han Solo (Harrison Ford) are tasked with saving Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) from captivity on a massive space station commanded by the menacing Darth Vader, whose deep mechanically augmented voice (contributed by James Earl Jones) became instantly iconic. At the core of the film and the series it initiated are the Jedi Knights—a group of either benevolent or malevolent warriors who harness and manipulate the Force, an all-pervasive spiritual essence that holds in balance the forces of good and evil—and Skywalker’s quest to join their ranks.

Armand and Paul, also Georges' brothers, were in charge of distribution and advertising, respectively. Armand ran distribution. Paul created the advertising, all of it in-house. Georges designed the clothes, burnishing Guess' signature style: stonewashed denim, lighter in color, softer and more form-fitting than the competitors. This initial chain of command later led to the earlier break-up of the brothers' cooperation with Georges selling his share of the Guess company to his other brothers due to a disagreement in a choice of product distribution strategy. Georges wanted to keep Guess in only the more exclusive stores, such as Bloomingdales. The remaining brothers in the disagreement wanted a larger distribution in KMart. Georges hated the idea. Different camps formed within the company, with each pledging allegiance to either Georges or the other three. Georges eventually gave in and sold his stake to his brothers in 1993 for $214.2 million. To finance the purchase, they had to borrow $210 million, and $105 million was still outstanding three years later. To raise money, the brothers decided to take Guess public. Paul was the only remaining brother to ultimately lead Guess on his own.", "Response": "Ah yes, they have been around a while. They started in 1981, but they didn't make jeans at first.

With this in mind, internships in engineering are definitely worth your attention. With all of the advancements in technology, engineers are going to continue to be needed; it’s a discipline that’s always going to be in-demand and on the lookout for the best and brightest minds. Internships in engineering will help put you in the right direction and decide which specialty you want to choose, since the versatile field of engineering has 17 of them, each with their own subdivisions. That means you can work on anything from artificial hearts to submarines—it’s all up to you. And you’ll definitely be getting your hands dirty (metaphorically, of course), because if you want to intern in engineering, you’ll have to be ready to work hard; only the astute will survive in this fascinating and high-tech industry. These positions aren’t without their perks, though: because of the long list of influential companies that an engineering intern can work with, many of the opportunities for students are paid, and some even offer tuition reimbursement. On top of all of this, as an engineering intern you’ll get a chance to see how an entire engineering company works, which can be beneficial later on, as many engineering grads tend to go into the business sector later on in life. Whatever you decide to do with your degree and your internship, you’ll be hard-pressed to find any downsides to gaining exposure to this diverse field.", "Response": "Yes.

Which cities would you suggest me to go to?", "Knowledge": "Fussen and Neuschwanstein Castle While many travelers pass through Fussen and head straight to Neuschwanstein Castle without a second thought, both are well worth a visit. Germany is full of fairytale castles but this one is special, tucked within the Bavarian Alps nearby. It is the most photographed structure in Germany and served as the inspiration for Walt Disney’s Sleeping Beauty Castle. Built in the late 19th century, it wasn’t meant for defense purposes as most castles were, but as an elaborate retreat for King Ludwig II of Bavaria. The interior of the castle can be explored through a guided tour, and horse-drawn carriage rides are available to bring you to the top of the hill if you don’t want to take the 30 to 50-minute walk to get there. In Fussen, you’ll find a lovely pedestrianized Old Town (Alstadt) lined with brightly colored buildings, many of which are adorned with frescoes. The cobblestone streets give the 700-year-old town an old world charm, and you can enjoy the traditional Bavarian fare at the restaurants and cafes. Second only to Berlin in size and population, Hamburg, a port city in northern Germany, is home to one of the biggest harbors in Europe. Take a stroll along its many waterways and canals, and you’ll immediately see why it’s been called the “Venice of the North.” With its flair and maritime charm, it truly is one of the most picturesque cities in all of Germany. It’s also famous for its nightlife hub, “Reeperbahn,” which also houses the city’s red light district, though this area tends to be quite a bit touristy. The Sternschanze offers an alternative scene, much more relaxed and less crowded. On a beautiful summer day, you can enjoy dining and soaking up the sun on one of the many terraces. You’ll have to eat a hamburger while you’re in Hamburg, and the best place to do it is Otto’s, near the central station. Rothenburg sits along Germany’s legendary Romantic Road. This spectacular medieval city that Rick Steves called a “fairy-tale dream town,” should be on or near the top of your must-visit list. If it looks familiar, that’s because it’s the very same town that inspired Walt Disney to create Pinocchio. It was also the location for the Vulgarian village scenes in 1968’s “Chitty Chitty Bang Bang.” The still-intact medieval walled city seems to exist in a time capsule – although about 40% of it was destroyed during the Second World War, locals quickly rebuilt it to its former style, reclaiming its magnificent architectural past. Walk the wall that encircles it to get various perspectives of the architecture from the Middle Ages, and climb to the top of the Rothenburg Town Hall Tower to get a wide angle view of the city and surrounding countryside.", "Response": "I would recommend Fussen, Rothenburg, and Berlin."}

The film stars Tyler Mane as the adult Michael Myers, Malcolm McDowell as Dr. Sam Loomis, and Scout Taylor-Compton as Laurie Strode; Daeg Faerch portrays a ten-year-old Michael Myers. Rob Zombie's \"reimagining\" follows the premise of John Carpenter's original, with Michael Myers stalking Laurie Strode and her friends on Halloween night. Zombie's film goes deeper into the character's psyche, trying to answer the question of what drove him to kill people, whereas in Carpenter's original film Michael did not have an explicit reason for killing. On Halloween in Haddonfield, Illinois, ten-year-old Michael Myers (Daeg Faerch), having already exhibited signs of psychopathy, murders a school bully (Daryl Sabara), his older sister Judith (Hanna R. Hall), her boyfriend Steve (Adam Weisman), and his mother's boyfriend Ronnie (William Forsythe). Only his baby sister, Angel Myers, is spared.

The film stars Sid Haig, Bill Moseley, Sheri Moon, and Karen Black as members of the Firefly family. Set on Halloween, the film sees the Firefly family torturing and mutilating a group of teenagers who are traveling across the country writing a book. The film explores a number of genres, and features elements of the supernatural. Zombie cited American horror films \"The Texas Chain Saw Massacre\" (1974) and \"The Hills Have Eyes\" (1977) as influences on \"House of 1000 Corpses\", as well as other films released during the 1970s. Initially filmed in 2000, \"House of 1000 Corpses\" was purchased by Universal Pictures, thus a large portion of it was filmed on the Universal Studios backlots. The film was made with a budget of $7 million. Zombie worked with Scott Humphrey on the score of the film. \"House of 1000 Corpses\" featured a graphic amount of blood and gore, and controversial scenes involving masturbation and necrophilia. The project was ultimately shelved by the company prior to its release due to fears of an NC-17 rating. Zombie later managed to re-purchase the rights to the work, eventually selling it to Lions Gate Entertainment. The film received a theatrical release on April 11, 2003, nearly three years after filming had concluded.", "Response": "House of 1,000 corpses was Rob Zombies directorial debut!

While struggling to maintain his newfound sobriety, BoJack is haunted by a tragedy from his past: the death of his former Horsin’ Around co-star, Sarah Lynn (Kristen Schaal), who fatally overdosed on his stash of heroin. It’s not just a celebrity story line, but one that tens of thousands of people experience in America.

A surreal trip into BoJack’s mind post-overdose, it is an eerie, sad glimpse of what appear to be his final moments of consciousness, moments that culminate in blackness and the sound of a heart monitor flatlining. BoJack is dead, one can fairly assume from that conclusion. (Well, one can assume it unless one’s savvy enough to watch all of the credits, during which the drone of the flatline starts to beep again, a signal he may not be fully gone after all.) On initial viewing, the episode implies that BoJack’s depression, addiction, and worst impulses finally killed him in the most Hollywoo of ways, leaving him face down in the pool behind the mansion he used to own, imagery reminiscent of a floating, murdered Joe Gillis in Sunset Boulevard. But BoJack Horseman doesn’t end this way. There’s a whole other final episode that explains that BoJack is eventually discovered in the pool, recovers in the hospital, goes on trial, winds up serving jail time for breaking and entering, then gets a one-night release so he can attend Princess Carolyn’s wedding. At first, as morbid as this is to say, I was a little disappointed that BoJack didn’t actually die, partly because that struck me as the more daring narrative choice.", "Response": "Bojack went through many themes and had multiple endings.

Despite the official timeline of events, this theory has quite a bit of backing due to the different settings that the series has featured over time, and while there are a few titles that act as direct sequels—Majora’s Mask and Zelda II—for the most part each title in the series can stand on its own without any kind of connection to the other stories that have been told.", "Response": "It seems like story was based on a collection of stories."}

Commanded by Princess Zelda, their ranks included Link, her knight and personal bodyguard, and a representative of each major race of Hyrule: Revali of the Rito, Daruk of the Gorons, Mipha of the Zora, and Urbosa of the Gerudo. While the other Champions piloted their race s respective Divine Beast, Zelda was sent on a pilgrimage under Link s protection, praying to statues of the goddess Hylia for the power to defeat Calamity Ganon. With the help of the Sheikah s Guardians and the Divine Beasts, the people of Hyrule prepared for the return of Calamity Ganon. During this time, the Champions bonded with each other, with Zelda growing especially fond of Link once she realized their similarities as people burdened with tremendous legacies to live up to. However, Zelda was unable to unlock her power in time, and Calamity Ganon proved to have learned from its previous defeat; using its nigh-limitless dark power, it killed the pilot champions, took control of the Guardians and Divine Beasts, and nearly killed Link. However, Zelda saved Link from the fatal blow, finally unlocking her power. Link was then sent to the Shrine of Resurrection on the Great Plateau, where he would recover in a deep sleep for the next one hundred years. Zelda returned the battle-damaged Master Sword to its pedestal in front of the Great Deku Tree, then used her power to seal Ganon and herself within Hyrule Castle. Link was reawakened because Zelda s power has dwindled over the past century, putting Hyrule at risk of Calamity Ganon s return.", "Response": "She actually plays a part in the story and contributes to the adventure."}

Lauren Bacall recalls in her autobiography,  One day Bogie came on the set and said to Howard,  Who pushed Taylor off the pier?  Everything stopped.  As A.M. Sperber and Eric Lax write in  Bogart,   Hawks sent Chandler a telegram asking whether the Sternwood s chauffeur, Owen Taylor, was murdered or a suicide.  Dammit I didn t know either,    Chandler recalled. And Chandler later wrote to his publisher,  The girl who played the nymphy sister (Martha Vickers) was so good she shattered Miss Bacall completely. So they cut the picture in such a way that all her best scenes were left out except one. The result made nonsense and Howard Hawks threatened to sue... After long argument, as I hear it, he went back and did a lot of re-shooting.", "Response": "Lauren Bacall was in it."}

I'd love to watch more movies she's been in, I really like her.", "Knowledge": "Without needing to exaggerate, To Have and Have Not is the movie that single-handedly changed Lauren s life. Not only was it her film debut, it’s, also, the movie that introduced her to the love of her life, Humphrey Bogart. Based on the novel by Ernest Hemingway, the story and characters were drastically changed in this film adaptation. The most notable difference is the change in setting (so as not to upset FDR’s Good Neighbor Policy). So, rather than Cuba, To Have and Have Not takes place in Fort de France, Martinique, shortly after the fall of France. Bogart stars as Harry Morgan, a fishing captain who is, reluctantly, enlisted by the French Resistance to smuggle fugitives onto the island. Lauren plays Marie “Slim” Browning, an American pickpocket who has become stranded on the island due to lack of funds. Of course, Slim and Harry soon start a romance and the sizzling chemistry of these two stars is the real reason to watch this movie. Lauren’s role of Slim was partially based on director, Howard Hawks’ wife (also, called Slim), who, actually, had a hand in bringing Lauren to her husband’s attention in the first place (she saw Lauren’s picture on the cover of Harper s Bazaar and asked Hawks to screen-test her). Despite being a mere 19 years old at the time, Lauren exudes a world-weary confidence as the smoky and mysterious Slim, immediately establishing her distinctive screen personae in her very first scene. In fact, her old soul quality makes the sizable age difference between her and Bogie (who was 45 at the time) almost imperceptible. In short, To Have and Have Not is a well-written drama with smart, memorable dialogue but, it, also, offers the rare opportunity to witness two actors, actually, fall in love on-camera.", "Response": "To Have and Have Not was her film debut and when she met Bogart."}

Your voice doesn’t actually change pitch with a lungful of helium: your vocal chords still vibrate at the same frequency. Rather, what changes is the natural frequency of your throat, so it resonates more strongly with the higher harmonics than the lower ones. The low frequency component of your voice is still there, but it is much quieter than the higher frequency component. The relative strength of these harmonics is called the ‘timbre’ and it is this that changes when you breathe helium. This is why you sound more like Donald Duck than Mickey Mouse.", "Response": "Technically it doesn't! Your vocal chords vibrate at the same frequency.

From apparel, like t-shirts, sweatshirts, and hats, to calendars, posters, mugs, water bottles, stickers, stuffed animals, buttons, messenger bags, and even clocks, CafePress offers hundreds of different products to sell and its thriving community of users creates over 45,000 new items each day on the site. Like CafePress, Zazzle offers a huge number of customizable products including t-shirts, sweatshirts, bags, ties, and even aprons, jackets, postage stamps, and shoes. They offer both custom on-demand printing and embroidery on many of their clothing products, and also offer a range of non-apparel items, such as skateboard decks, calendars, magnets, and post cards. Zazzle users have created a mind blowing 19.5 billion items. While the focus on Spreadshirt is on t-shirts and sweatshirts, they also offer a range of accessory items that can be printed with your designs, including bags, aprons, buttons, and neckties. One of Spreadshirt s strengths is the ease of use of its online product designer, making is really easy for anyone to make or customize products that can then be sold to the public. Pikistore does t-shirts and a few other customizable items, such as mugs and mousepads, and does it with a flair that other print-on-demand publishers would be hard pressed to match. For those who want a really great looking storefront from which to sell their t-shirts, perhaps one that matches the look and feel of an existing web site, then Pikistore might be a good option to check out. CreateSpace, which is owned by Amazon, lets authors, musicians, and filmmakers create print-on-demand books, CDs, and DVDs. The main advantage to using CreateSpace is that because it is owned by Amazon, your products  inclusion in the Amazon catalog is guaranteed. That means you can also sell on the Kindle, via the Amazon MP3 store, and offer movie downloads (which means availability on the Xbox 360 and certain TiVo players). Being guaranteed a spot in Amazon s marketplace can mean a huge boost to your potential sales. Anyone who watches Project Runway knows that the right print can make or break a good design.

For many people, sports rank right up there with religion, politics and relationships on the importance scale. Occasionally sports can dominate the attention of the world in the form of the Olympics, World Cup or Super Bowl. But one crucial component of sports often gets overlooked – the playing field. Rarely does a sports field receive any special attention from players or fans unless something’s wrong with it. Little do folks understand the countless hours of preparation that go into a professional athletic field. Professional turfgrass management is a rigorous science and art, working behind the scenes to provide the best playing surface possible for athletes. Each sport is unique and utilizes the playing field in unique ways. Because of this it’s important to understand which types of grasses are best for each sport.", "Response": "I know the turf can be very important for a good game. Do you use a special grass?"}

Black Panther has received nearly universal critical acclaim and been lauded for using the characters and setting to make allegorical points about race relations in America. The Iron Man franchise shows how modern technology - if used responsibly - can serve humanity s benefit, as an iron suit and electromagnet give Tony Stark his power. The Guardians of the Galaxy and Avengers franchises illustrate the necessity of harmony and cooperation between allies to face down larger threats.

That’s not just a career assessment. It’s a physical reality. To gear up as the iconic Marvel superhero, Chris Evans, the star of the upcoming “Captain America: The Winter Soldier,” once again dons his trademark patriotic suit, which requires the actor to wear a snug latex undergarment that keeps the uniform from clinging to his sculpted muscles. The same could be said of the ironclad six-movie deal Evans signed when he joined the Marvel universe in 2010 as mild-mannered Steve Rogers, who becomes the supernatural shielded crusader — the original Avenger. He’s completed three films as the character, including the 2011 “Captain America” origins story and last summer’s blockbuster hit “The Avengers,” which grossed $1.5 billion worldwide. Evans heads to London to shoot “Avengers 2” alongside superhero pals Robert Downey Jr. (Iron Man), Chris Hemsworth (Thor), Scarlett Johansson (Black Widow) and Jeremy Renner (Hawkeye) after his press tour for the April 4 release of “The Winter Soldier,” in which Johansson also appears. Evans recently made news when he said he plans a short break from acting after his Marvel run ends, but now, he tells Variety, he wants to retire from being in front of the camera. “If I’m acting at all, it’s going to be under Marvel contract, or I’m going to be directing,” he says. “I can’t see myself pursuing acting strictly outside of what I’m contractually obligated to do.”", "Response": "I see.

EOS If it will stop raining, I'm going to plant some corn and okra this week.", "Knowledge": "Corn needs plenty of space for two reasons — it is a heavy feeder, and it is primarily pollinated by wind. As grains of pollen are shed by the tassels that grow from the plants’ tops, they must find their way to the delicate strands of silk that emerge from newly formed ears. To make sure silks are nicely showered with pollen, grow corn in blocks of short rows rather than in a long, single row. In a small garden, 15 plants set 1 foot apart can be grown in a 3 x 5-foot bed. Growing corn on this tiny scale is a good way to introduce yourself to the crop if you’ve never grown it. After the first year you will probably want to increase the size of the planting to at least 4 rows 10 feet long.", "Response": "Do you really need plenty of space to grow corn.

EOS Ohhh yes I like the black bass very much", "Knowledge": "This east Texas lake rose to the top of the 2018 list thanks to the sheer number of huge sacks the reservoir produced. How has the lake changed in the past 12 months? Not much. The lake continues to pump out huge limits of bass — with some beasts included in the mix. Proof was given this April when 20 of the 21 hourly winning bass in the Sealy Big Bass Splash exceeded 7 pounds, with the one exception missing the 7-pound mark by .04 pounds. Big stringers also are common. In May 2018, a 25.78-pound stringer was required to win the Media Bass Texas Deep East Team tournament on Rayburn, with two 8-pounders crossing the scales. Oh, did we mention the Bass Champs Shootout last June, during which the Top 10 teams had more than 22 pounds, with the winner breaking 28 pounds? Big bass for that event was 10.92 pounds. Even more remarkable was the 40.28-pound sack weighed in during the June Texas Team Trail Championship. That team went on to win the two-day event with 10 bass going 64.09 pounds. And then on July 7, in the heat of the Texas summer, the lake really shone when the same team tournament produced two stringers topping the 28-pound mark — with the heaviest sack logging in at 29.4 pounds. Yeah, this lake is still best in class.", "Response": "Do you have anywhere you like to go in particular for bass fishing?

Percy and Annabeth first meet in The Lightning Thief when Percy wakes up after passing out to see Annabeth, whom he described as  pretty , spoon-feeding him nectar and ambrosia, the food of the gods. Percy is confused and irritated by Annabeth s behavior in the beginning of The Lightning Thief, but they develop a solid friendship at the end of the novel from all they had experienced together. In The Battle of the Labyrinth, Percy and Annabeth were supposed to meet up after school for lunch and a movie which Percy s mother, Sally, referred to as a  date  and teased him about it. It is revealed in The Sea of Monsters that Percy carried a picture of Annabeth in his binder and that Annabeth had been tailing Percy with her cap of invisibility on. In The Titan s Curse, Percy meets Aphrodite (Percy momentarily thought she resembled Annabeth), who tells him that he will have a tragic love life; incidentally, Percy meets Rachel a little while after. At the end of the book, he nearly has a heart attack, thinking Annabeth was about to join the Hunters of Artemis. Annabeth kisses him four times, once after winning the chariot race in The Sea of Monsters, though that was only on the cheek, again as she leaves him to fight the telekhines at Mount St. Helens in The Battle of the Labyrinth, in the dining area of Camp Half-Blood, prior to all the other campers throwing them in the canoe lake in The Last Olympian, where they share an underwater kiss. Also in The Last Olympian when Percy and Annabeth were inspecting Athena s cabin, Percy states that  sure, she d always been cute, but she was starting to be seriously beautiful . When Percy goes to the River Styx to bathe, he is supposed to envision the one thing that keeps him tied to the mortal world. He thinks of Annabeth pulling him out of the water at the canoe lake. Annabeth is also the only person who knows Percy s vulnerable spot. When Kronos is spotted during the battle in The Last Olympian, Percy orders a retreat, but Annabeth stays behind to help him, taking a knife that would have killed him. At the end of The Last Olympian when Luke is dying, he asks Annabeth if she ever loved him, to which she replies that she only loved him as a brother, looking up to Percy.In the second series, they are dating and shown to be in love. Several times, both Annabeth and Percy say that they cannot live without the other. They say that they love each other and kiss throughout the books.

In choral music without instrumental accompaniment, the bass is supplied by adult male bass singers. For an accompanied choir, the bass is typically provided by pipe organ or piano (or if a choir can afford to hire one, by orchestra). In an orchestra, the basslines are played by the double bass and cellos, bassoon or contrabassoon, low brass such as the tuba and bass trombone, and the timpani (kettledrums). In many styles of traditional music such as Bluegrass, folk, and in styles such as Rockabilly and Big Band and Bebop jazz, the bass role is filled by the upright bass. In most rock and pop bands and in jazz fusion groups, the bass role is filled by the electric bass.

Characteristic that distinguishes physical entities having biological processes Temporal range: 4280–0 Ma Plants in the Rwenzori Mountains, Uganda Domains and Supergroups Life on Earth: Non-cellular life?[note 1] [note 2] Viruses[note 3] This article is one of a series on: Habitability of Venus Habitability of Mars Habitability of Enceladus Habitability of Europa Habitability of Titan Life outside the Solar System There is currently no consensus regarding the definition of life. One popular definition is that organisms are open systems that maintain homeostasis, are composed of cells, have a life cycle, undergo metabolism, can grow, adapt to their environment, respond to stimuli, reproduce and evolve. Other definitions sometimes include non-cellular life forms such as viruses and viroids. Abiogenesis is the natural process of life arising from non-living matter, such as simple organic compounds. The prevailing scientific hypothesis is that the transition from non-living to living entities was not a single event, but a gradual process of increasing complexity. Life on Earth first appeared as early as 4.28 billion years ago, soon after ocean formation 4.41 billion years ago, and not long after the formation of the Earth 4.54 billion years ago.[1][2][3][4] The earliest known life forms are microfossils of bacteria.[5][6] Researchers generally think that current life on Earth descends from an RNA world,[7] although RNA-based life may not have been the first life to have existed.[8][9] The classic 1952 Miller–Urey experiment and similar research demonstrated that most amino acids, the chemical constituents of the proteins used in all living organisms, can be synthesized from inorganic compounds under conditions intended to replicate those of the early Earth. Complex organic molecules occur in the Solar System and in interstellar space, and these molecules may have provided starting material for the development of life on Earth.[10][11][12][13] Since its primordial beginnings, life on Earth has changed its environment on a geologic time scale, but it has also adapted to survive in most ecosystems and conditions. Some microorganisms, called extremophiles, thrive in physically or geochemically extreme environments that are detrimental to most other life on Earth. The cell is considered the structural and functional unit of life.[citation needed] There are two kinds of cells, prokaryotic and eukaryotic, both of which consist of cytoplasm enclosed within a membrane and contain many biomolecules such as proteins and nucleic acids. Cells reproduce through a process of cell division, in which the parent cell divides into two or more daughter cells. In the past, there have been many attempts to define what is meant by  life  through obsolete concepts such as odic force, hylomorphism, spontaneous generation and vitalism, that have now been disproved by biological discoveries. Aristotle was the first person to classify organisms. Later, Carl Linnaeus introduced his system of binomial nomenclature for the classification of species. Eventually new groups and categories of life were discovered, such as cells and microorganisms, forcing dramatic revisions of the structure of relationships between living organisms. Though currently only known on Earth, life need not be restricted to it, and many scientists speculate in the existence of extraterrestrial life. Artificial life is a computer simulation or human-made reconstruction of any aspect of life, which is often used to examine systems related to natural life. 1.1.1 Alternative definitions 1.1.2 Viruses 1.2 Biophysics 1.3 Living systems theories 1.3.1 Gaia hypothesis 1.3.2 Nonfractionability", "Response": "Life style improve maintain in your house and relatives"}

A specially designed installation in shades of blue features five large works on paper and a series consisting of smaller works that are available based on the wages equivalent to one day’s work. Exploring the intersection of contemporary craft and social practice, Aminlari employs geometry and abstraction with a rhythmic intensity matched by ideas surrounding the transnational dissemination and intercultural reception of embroidery, the color blue, and labor. Inspired by a trip to Porto, Portugal, Aminlari discovered the unmistakable Persian influences of blue, the interlocking curvilinear, geometric, and floral motifs used in the Azulejo tiles (painted tin-glazed ceramic tilework found on the interior and exterior of churches, palaces, ordinary houses, schools, restaurants, bars, etc.). Encountering these works, Aminlari felt a full-circle-effect transcendent of time and place. Returning to New York, Aminlari’s multi-layered process began with coats of blue gouache, followed by meticulously hand-stitching geometric shapes, in colored and 24-karat gold vintage Japanese metallic threads, onto the painted paper. The works are matted and framed in blues and hang in a blue gallery. Viewers are invited to sit on an indigo carpet and engage with 72 six-inch-square works held within a custom-made box. Allowing people to create their own patterns using the tile-sized artworks, Aminlari considers authorship, viewership, ownership, and class in the art field. Offering the works for one day’s wage mirrors Aminlari’s personal labor in creating the artwork. For instance, if someone makes New York City’s 2019 minimum wage ($13.50/hr), then the work is available for $108, and retail increases accordingly. Questions concerning the accessibility to art, in combination with recent minimum and living wage activism, drove Aminlari to devise this system of obtaining art independent from the usual artist/gallery pricing strategies. The end results are a matrix of mosaic patterns that simultaneously build upon and eclipse any singular class or culture. ABDOLREZA AMINLARI (b. 1979, Tehran) lives and works in Brooklyn, NY. Aminlari received his BFA from the College for Creative Studies, Detroit and his work has been nationally and Internationally exhibited, including Andrew Rafacz, Chicago; Taymour Grahne, New York; Abrons Art Center, New York; KVKM Kunstverein Cologne; Cuadro Gallery, Dubai; Longhouse Projects, New York; Jackie Klempay, Brooklyn; Black Ball Projects, Brooklyn; and the Derfner Judaica Museum, New York.

{"Context": "My favorite drink is red wine. Red wine (69%) is the most popular among wine-drinking adults", "Knowledge": "First things first, red wine is well…red, but why? Its color can be derived from a vast assortment of grape varietals ranging from grapes that are reddish, deep purple, and even a beautiful blue on the color scale. These grapes give rise to a wine that is color classified with such descriptors as garnet, almost black, dark red, light red, ruby red, opaque purple, deep violet, maroon, and the list goes on. It is the grape skins that are responsible for the red wine’s distinct color spectrum. The skins are in contact with the grape’s juice during the fermentation process, allowing the dispersion of both color and tannins. The individual wine’s particular red hue depends on the grape type used in the process and the length of time the skin’s pigmentation is in contact with the juice.

If you find yourself confronted by a bear, create a ruckus -- the louder the better. You can shout, scream, clap your hands or bang pots together. Electronic personal alarms can also help scare bears away. Avoid advancing on a bear, while making loud noises; ensure he has a way to retreat. Like most other animals, bears are less likely to attack large, seemingly formidable animals, than they are those that do not appear so dangerous. Use this to your advantage by raising your arms over your head, spreading your coat with your arms or waving something in the air. If you are traveling with others, clump yourselves together to appear as one large animal. This not only helps prevent the bear from singling out a member of the party, but it helps to intimidate the bear as well.", "Response": "Loud noise can scare most bears.

Both preview new or potential members of the growing Atlas family and are based on the already-existing three-row SUV. VW has already confirmed the Atlas Cross Sport five-seater is coming to the market with the aim of introducing an SUV with a coupe-like roofline at an attainable price point. Although VW capped their prototypes at an 18-mph speed limit, that didn t stop us from gleaning new information about the imaginings of what we can expect in the future. Here are a few cool things we learned about these two concept vehicles during our drive on Monterey s famous 17-Mile Drive. It s a safe bet that the majority of CUVs on the road use unit body designs and we can t complain because it makes the high-riding vehicles handle a lot better. The Atlas family is no exception; both of the concepts we drove were variations on VW s  Modular Transversal Toolkit  platform, or MQB for short. The Cross Sport will share more with the standard Atlas than the Tanoak would, but our tester was all Atlas ahead of the B-Pillars. It drove like it too.

Brain Bus  to conduct regional events throughout the United States and Canada.[100] Participants who correctly answer at least 35 out of 50 questions advance in the audition process and are invited to attend in-person group auditions throughout the country. At these auditions, a second written exam is administered, followed by a mock game and interviews. Those who are approved are notified at a later time and invited to appear on the show. Eligibility is limited to persons who have never been on the show, and have not been to an in-person audition in at least 18 months.[101]", "Response": "The audition seems difficult.

Chef Puck immediately hired Chef LaDou to work at the newly opened Spago in 1982 and Chef LaDou continued creating innovative pizzas, including varieties with duck sausage and smoked salmon. In the 1940s, Pizzeria Uno in Chicago developed the deep-dish pizza, which has a deep crust that lines a deep dish, similar to a large metal cake or pie pan. Though the entire pizza is quite thick, the crust itself is only of thin to medium thickness, and the pizza has a very thick large layer of toppings.

So people must be happy with the amount of nuggets they get. EOS I’m from Georgia where it was founded I grew up on chick-fil-a still those ppl must never cook chicken nuggets u can get a whole pan of nuggets from one breasts EOS That's probably because most chicken nuggets you get a McDonald's and Chick-fil-a are formed rather than cut from the chicken breast.

Annabelle  (2014) The evil doll named Annabelle was introduced in the first “Conjuring” as the most wicked trinket in the Warren Family vault of horrors, but you wouldn’t know it from watching her first solo film. “Annabelle” takes place in the apartment an impossibly boring family, where the struggling housewife (Annabelle Wallis, “The Mummy”) gradually realizes that their newest collectible doll is evil. It’s a film devoid of genuine dread, which relies entirely on predictable “boo” scares to get a rise out of the audience. 4.  The Nun  (2018) Corin Hardy’s “Conjuring” sequel features nifty monster effects and spooky locations, but it plays more like a gothic adventure than a horror movie. And as a gothic adventure, it’s uneven, waffling haphazardly between gross, goofy and grim. Demián Bichir and Taissa Farmiga star as agents of the Vatican, investigating the mysterious death of a nun, only to discover that the isolated convent is actually a prison for an ancient evil. “The Nun” is fast-paced, and certainly never boring, but the total lack of subtlety makes it hard to take seriously, let alone get scared. 3.  The Conjuring 2  (2016) Sequelitis strikes in “The Conjuring 2,” an effective but bloated follow-up that features more demons, more domestic strife, and more audacious shocks. Once again, Ed and Lorraine Warren find themselves in a based-on-a-true-ghost-story: The Enfield Poltergeist, which tormented a working-class family in the late 1970s. It’s a nail-biter, with some standout set pieces and terrifying villains, but director James Wan crams so much content into one film that the pacing can’t help but suffer. 2.  Annabelle: Creation  (2017) The prequel to the first “Conjuring” prequel is a rollercoaster of a horror movie, a scary and surprising crowd-pleaser that finally does the creepy doll proud. A group of orphans move into a home with a strange family, whose daughter died tragically, and after one of the young girls discovers a spooky doll in the deceased child’s bedroom, all hell breaks loose. David F. Sandberg knows how to build suspense and how to pay off that eeriness in unexpected, popcorn-spilling explosions of nightmare fuel. 1.  The Conjuring  (2013) The original “The Conjuring” is still the classiest, spookiest, most satisfying film in the franchise. Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga are wholly believable as real-life supernatural investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren, who take on a terrifying new job when a troubled, working-class family moves in with an evil spirit. “The Conjuring” subtly builds a mythology while telling a satisfying, terrifying, self-contained ghost story, with a standout performance from Lili Taylor as the matriarch whose pent-up anxieties become disturbing realities. James Wan took the operatic style he developed for the “Insidious” movies, and this time uses it as a counterpoint to plausible, dramatic subtlety. It’s Wan’s best film, and a modern horror classic.", "Response": "I think so too. All of the conjuring movies have turned out pretty well at the box office and in reviews."}

Orange Is the New Black was a near-instant smash when it debuted last summer, and eventually became Netflix’s most popular original program. Though much of the show’s appeal lies in its brilliant ensemble cast, helmed by celebrated show-runner Jenji Kohan of Weeds fame, the relationship between Vause (called Nora in the book) and Piper Chapman provides a lot of its addictive propulsion. On the show, Vause and Kerman’s alter-ego, Chapman, are surprised to be re-united in prison years after the globe-spanning, drug- and money-trafficking romance that landed them both behind bars. The sultry, smoky-voiced Laura Prepon of That ‘70s Show fame plays Vause, while Taylor Schilling, that gorgeous blond actress with the hypnotic Crest teeth, plays Chapman as they act out a season-long dance of on-again, off-again attraction. When I ask if she’s a fan of the show at all, Wolters offers a truly conflicted response. She says she and Kerman eventually made peace during their Chicago layover, and she sounds genuinely proud of Kerman’s decision to put her own story out there. “That takes balls the size of Oklahoma,” she says.

The sound is made by shoes that have a metal  tap  on the heel and toe. There are several major variations on tap dance including: flamenco, rhythm (jazz) tap, classical tap, Broadway tap, and post-modern tap. Broadway tap is rooted in English theatrical tradition and often focuses on formations, choreography and generally less complex rhythms; it is widely performed in musical theatre. Rhythm tap focuses on musicality, and practitioners consider themselves to be a part of the jazz tradition. Classical tap has a similarly long tradition which marries European  classical  music with American foot drumming with a wide variation in full-body expression. Post-modern or contemporary tap has emerged over the last three decades to incorporate abstract expression, thematic narrative and technology.", "Response": "I think the rhythm and percussion of tap dance would make for a fun game vibe"}

There are five varieties of Pacific salmon: Coho/Silver, King/Chinook, Sockeye, Pink, and Chum/Keta. Most Pacific Salmon is wild, but there are some instances where it is farmed. Farm-Raised: Fish that are endangered in the wild are often raised in aquacultures, or “fish farms,” to control overfishing. “Farm-raised” goes hand-in-hand with Atlantic salmon, and has attracted criticism due to its devastating environmental effects. However, some aquaculture methods are better than others, so it’s important to know which one applies to your salmon. Approach salmon raised in net-pens with caution—this practice allows waste and feed to flow freely, potentially contaminating the surrounding ecosystem. From a nutrition angle, farmed salmon contains more saturated fat than wild, which is typically leaner. Arctic Char: With a similar taste and appearance to salmon (they’re from the same family), arctic char is considered a sustainable and equally-as-tasty alternative. Most char are farmed, but in closed tank aquacultures. Seafood Watch approves Char that are farmed in closed tank aquacultures.", "Response": "Wild caught pacific salmon is excellent and better than any farm raised variety.

Its silvery skin is dappled with pink along the lateral line, and the fish sports green and blue coloration on its back and upper sides. Arctic char is also anadromous like salmon, migrating from northern lakes to saltwater to spawn. But, instead of dying afterward like its salmon cousin, the char can live for 25 years. The Inuit of Canada have enjoyed char for hundreds of years; they freeze the fish and eat them like Popsicles. Wild-harvested char come from remote, icy waters of Europe, Asia and North America. Northern Canada is the prime supplier, with Iceland close behind. These two are also the major suppliers of farmed char. The typical market size for the fish is between 2 and 8 pounds. Some farms raise pan-sized fish weighing 8 to 10 ounces. In Canada, gillnets, weirs and trap nets are used to harvest wild Arctic char.

Through various methods, the most common of which is hand seals, chakra can be controlled and manipulated to create an effect that would not be possible otherwise, such as walking on water, exhaling fire, or creating illusions. Chakra is ordinarily not visible to the unaided eye unless it is highly concentrated or manifested in large amounts. This is rarely seen due to the restrictions of eight specific tenketsu known as the Eight Gates, which limit the amount of chakra an individual can release at a single given time. The two components of chakra: physical energy and spiritual energy. Chakra is created when two other forms of energy, known collectively as one s  stamina , are moulded together. Physical energy (身体エネルギー, shintai enerugī) is collected from each and every one of the body s cells and can be increased through training, stimulants, and exercise. Spiritual energy (精神エネルギー, seishin enerugī, English TV: Mental Energy) is derived from the mind s consciousness and can be increased through studying, meditation, and experience. These two energies becoming more powerful will in turn make the created chakra more powerful. Therefore, practising a technique repeatedly will build up experience, increasing one s spiritual energy, and thus allowing more chakra to be created. As a result, the ninja is able to do that same technique with more power. This same cycle applies for physical energy, except the ninja needs to increase their endurance instead. Some unique individuals have substantial potential that enable them to exponentially increase their chakra reserves in a relatively short amount of time.", "Response": "The chakra is a concept that is also handled in real life.

{"Context": "My favorite hobby is Sculpting. I especially like working with clay", "Knowledge": "Press molding has been defined as ‘a technique in which clay is forced into a mold in order to take the shape of the mold, and then removed to form a ‘positive’ of the mold’. Therefore, press molds are great for many reasons, namely as an easy way of reproducing multiple pieces of ceramics from bowls to plates to tiles. With this method you can also create pottery shapes that would be difficult to produce on the wheel. You can repeat the shape again and again and save yourself a lot of time in the process. Press molds can also be known as sprig molds, which Pottery Magic concisely describe as being ‘one-piece molds from which flat-backed, shallow castings are produced when a piece of clay is forced into the impression’. Sprig molds are also used for creating raised decorations, commonly seen in the infamous Wedgewood pottery. Wedgewood was founded by Josiah Wedgewood, who is known as ‘the Father of English Potters’ and has been manufactured in Stoke on Trent in the UK since 1759. There are two main types of press molds. The first and most common is the plaster cast press mold, which is made with plaster of Paris with a material like talc mixed in (this shortens the setting time for plaster of Paris and also helps lessen the risk of cracking). The liquid mixture is then poured into a rubber mold and set. Plaster cast molds are still fired like ceramics to remove the water content, but at a much lower temperature (usually a maximum of 500 degrees Fahrenheit). Another type of mold is the bisque mold, which is super easy to make yourself. All you need to do is roll out your clay, to whatever thickness you desire (around three eighths of an inch is a good thickness to start with). Make sure your clay is rolled completely evenly, using rolling clay slab sticks. Then you can use whatever you like to create your mold, anything from cake tins to plates. A great idea is to use the open end of a bucket to place your rolled clay on top of, letting the clay dip as deep as you want your plate or bowl mold to be. Make sure you line whatever you are using as a mold, so your clay doesn’t stick and let it dry to leather hard. Then it’s ready for bisque fire to the required temperature. You can also slip cast molds with liquid clay or form your mold over Styrofoam, which is especially great (not to mention easy) if you’re carving your own design into it. You can also also use objects like shells to press into clay molds to create your form.", "Response": "Clay has diverse uses in the art world.

There are many management techniques to achieve many artistic pieces, and it is very common for people not to follow the usual recommendations such as using water, a lathe and care. EOS You are well versed! Do you know which clay is considered to be of the highest quality?", "Knowledge": "Oil-based clays are made from various combinations of oils, waxes and clay minerals. Because the oils do not evaporate as water would. Oil-based clays remain malleable even when left for long periods in dry environments. Articles made from oil-based clays cannot be fired, and therefore are not ceramics. Because the viscosity of oils decreases as temperature rises, the malleability is influenced by heating or cooling the clay. Oil-based clays can be heated, melted and then poured. Oil-based clay is not soluble in water. It can be re-used and so is a popular material for animation artists who need to bend and move their models. It is available in a multitude of colors and is non-toxic. However, some oil-based clay contains sulfur which prevents certain silicone mold rubbers from curing. In which case, non-sulfur oil-based clay should be substituted. Popular brands of oil-based clays include, DeMilano, Chavant and Roma Water-based clays- Originally developed for use in sculpting Disney s animatronics models, WED (Walter E. Disney) clay is an extremely versatile water-based clay with properties similar to many of today s most popular oil based clays. It s smooth, slow drying, extremely pliable, and works great for sculptors seeking a  fast sculpt  medium. WED clay is still commonly used by professionals in the entertainment industry for masks, modeling, mockup, and large scale sculptures. Like any water based clay, WED clay needs to be kept moist, preferably with a spray bottle or a damp towel. Saran wrap is also commonly used. It is not formulated to be fired. Polymer clays –This is a type of modeling clay based on the polymer polyvinyl chloride (PVC) which can be hardened. Polymer clay is generally used for making arts and craft items, and is also used in commercial applications to make decorative parts. Art made from polymer clay can now be found in major museums. Polymer clay remains workable until cured generally from between 265 F (129 C) to 275 F (135 C) for 15-minutes per 1⁄4-inch (6.4 mm) of thickness. This temperature is significantly less than for mineral clays and can be achieved using a home oven. The clay does not shrink when cured. Brands of polymer clay include Fimo, Sculpey, Premo, Cernit, Formello, Modello,Du-Kit and Kato Polyclay. Polymer clay safety is the subject of concern specifically the long-term effects of exposure to certain phthalate plasticizers that have been classified a endocrine disruptors. Dough clay-is a modeling clay, which may be edible or inedible whichresembles the product PlayDoh®, and is often, in fact, called playdough. Playdoughs are easily made at home in both cooked and uncooked versions, and are less expensive than some of the other types of clay. They are made of such ingredients as flour, cornstarch, cream of tartar, oil, and water. They can be colored when made, for example, with food coloring, or have color added after.", "Response": "Yes, clay is of great quality thanks to the properties it has and the way it is built.

Traditional ceramics include objects made of clay and cements that have been hardened by heating at high temperatures. Traditional ceramics are used in dishes, crockery, flowerpots, and roof and wall tiles. Advanced ceramics include carbides, such as silicon carbide, SiC; oxides, such as aluminum oxide, Al 2 O 3 ; nitrides, such as silicon nitride, Si 3 N 4 ; and many other materials, including the mixed oxide ceramics that can act as superconductors. Advanced ceramics require modern processing techniques, and the development of these techniques has led to advances in medicine and engineering. Some ceramics are composed of only two elements. For example, alumina is aluminum oxide, Al 2 O 3 ; zirconia is zirconium oxide, ZrO 2 ; and quartz is Ceramics are good insulators and can withstand high temperatures. A popular use of ceramics is in artwork. silicon dioxide, SiO 2 . Other ceramic materials, including many minerals, have complex and even variable compositions. For example, the ceramic mineral feldspar, one of the components of granite, has the formula KAlSi 3 O 8 .", "Response": "There're variations like aluminia, zirconia and silicon.

I like make large sculptures, but need a clay which does not need to be fired.  Do you know of a clay which will harden without heat?", "Knowledge": "Usually, the clay cracks in the drying process. Air-dry clay shrinks a little bit when drying and if the outside is drying faster than the inside of the sculpture - the surface cracks. You can solve this by sculpting in layers and waiting a little bit for them to dry. If you sculpt in bigger chunks the oven with ventilator might help as well. Set the oven on the lowest setting and keep an eye on your sculpture. The heat can penetrate to the deeper layers and dry it more evenly, because air-dry is porous. Air-dry clay is very good for that! Actually, most of the detailing I do is by carving. For dry clay carving, make sure that your tools are very sharp. The clay can get crumbly, because of the paper fibres, if you re carving with a blunt scalpel. One of my favourite way is to wet the surface a little bit and then carve with a needle or any other tool. Make sure that your sculpture is completely dry and wet just the top layer of the clay. Usually, air-dry clays are paper-based, that’s why they have such fluffy and lightweight texture. But all those paper fibres get very visible once the clay is dry. To minimise this irritating characteristic choose stone clay, for example, “La Doll” or “Premier”. They still have fibres, but less than usual paper clays.", "Response": "You could use the same clay, but instead of using heat, use another type of ventilation.

I'm also looking for the best tools.  Do you know what tool is best for doing fine detail work on clay?", "Knowledge": "If you are sculpting in ceramic (pottery) clay, which is soft moist clay, a wire end tool will not require the same cutting ability as that used when working in other mediums. A somewhat sharper cutting edge is necessary when working in wax and Plastilina since the material is firmer and detail work may be performed. And a tool that is ground extremely sharp or has very strong cutting edges will be necessary if working in plaster. The same theory holds true for tools made from high impact plastic, chrome, stainless steel and hard woods. The size of the tools you choose to sculpt with will also be determined by the size of the finished model. For example, a small medallion or bas-relief will not require the same modeling tools you might use to sculpt a head that is twice life size. You may have guessed that some of these modeling tools are interchangeable. That is, a tool that is used for working in Plastilina and wax may also be used when working in plaster or in mold making and casting.", "Response": "Apart from using your hands to mold clay, you can opt for a mechanical lathe,a flexible wire to cut the clay remains and some separate tools such as shovels (small, for gardening not) to shape the sculptures"}

The thought of Halo coming to the PlayStation 4 is not as wild as it once was, then – although it does, at first blush, still seem pretty crazy. Speaking on a recent episode of the Sacred Symbols podcast, however, ex-IGN editor Colin Moriarty reckons that a port of the Master Chief Collection was, at one point, being considered for Sony’s system. Halo’s franchise director Frank O’Connor has since weighed in on the rumour, stating that he’s “not aware of the details of conversations between the platforms at a corporate level but the distance between ‘plans’ and some ‘what if for instance’ conversations is a meaningful gulf”. He added: “We’ve had plenty of those over the years, but not one line of code was even glanced at.” So it seems that if there’s any truth to the rumour, it never got much further than the consideration stage. Whether those discussions will go further in the future remains to be seen: Microsoft does seem determined to get its software and services in as many hands as possible, and that could result in unexpected partnerships. For now, though, we’re going to assume that any chance of Master Chief appearing on PlayStation is low – of course, there’s always Dreams.", "Response": "I have not, I play on playstation and it doesn't have Halo."}

It has been hailed by many critics as one of the greatest films of all time.[1] The couple travel to Paris to deliver cargo, enjoying a makeshift honeymoon en route.

What did the studio think wasn’t commercial in the fable-ish tale of newlyweds Jean (Jean Dasté), a barge captain, and naïve country girl Juliette (a glowing Dita Parlo)? The emphasis on an elusive mood over a taut story? The remnants of 1920s-era surrealism that occasionally adorned Vigo’s vision and pacing? The carnival-esque touches and dreamlike nature of certain sequences? Certainly not the multiplying cats, who hover, dart through and slink across the frame in the boat scenes like born photo-bombers.

Juliette finds herself tempted to experience the city, while Jean’s jealousy kicks in — at first, of all things, toward Simon’s grimy crew hand Père Jules, whose exotic possessions collected from around the world (some eerie, some sexual) entrance Juliette. That’s followed by the couple’s excursion to a café on land, which puts them in the cross-hairs of a flirtatious peddler whose attention toward Juliette further introduces a frisson of doubt into the union. So much so that later, when Juliette sneaks off the barge at night to taste more of Paris, Jean sets sail in the morning without her. “L’Atalante” is about how the world, in its wonder and cruelty, is both for and against lovers, often dizzyingly so. And what splendidly captures this as well as anything is Maurice Jaubert’s wonderful score, which Vigo used judiciously, often marrying it exquisitely to diegetic rhythms (a far-off bell, industrial clacking, an on-screen accordion) for enthralling effect. It’s a brilliant early example of the possibilities the sound era offered in framing a story’s emotions to carry a moviegoer along. Jaubert’s tuneful contribution is made all the more hypnotic by the many earthy, realistic sequences in which no music plays. That way, when it emerges, as when it decorates the movie’s famous crosscutting of its separated lovers — she in a drab hotel, he on the barge — in simultaneous erotic reverie, the effect is memorably overwhelming.", "Response": "Dita Parlo was glowing as a newlywed wife.

Once there, Mr. Wonka demonstrated his latest invention, Television Chocolate, which was seemingly impossible as he clearly had no clue about how science and television work. When Mike tried to teach him the basics, he dismissed it as mumbling. He then proceeded to send a large bar of chocolate from one end of the room to another, with the bar appearing on a TV screen from which it can be taken out by the viewer. While the group were impressed by what Mr. Wonka had done, Mike was surprised when Mr. Wonka dismissed any other suggestions to send through the teleporter and replies (while smiling a little),  Don t you even realize what you ve invented? It s a teleporter. It s the most important invention in the history of the world. And all you ever think about is chocolate.", "Response": "Yeah it got a bit complex with teleporters and all."}

These paintings of scenes of contemporary life, of aristocratic and popular pastimes, were begun under the direction of the German artist Anton Raphael Mengs, a great exponent of Neoclassicism who, after Tiepolo’s death, had become undisputed art dictator at the Spanish court. In Goya’s early cartoons the influence of Tiepolo’s decorative style is modified by the teachings of Mengs, particularly his insistence on simplicity. The later cartoons reflect his growing independence of foreign traditions and the development of an individual style, which began to emerge through his study of the paintings of the 17th-century court painter Diego Velázquez in the royal collection, many of which he copied in etchings (c. 1778). Later in life he is said to have acknowledged three masters: Velázquez, Rembrandt, and, above all, nature. Rembrandt’s etchings were doubtless a source of inspiration for his later drawings and engravings, while the paintings of Velázquez directed him to the study of nature and taught him the language of realism.", "Response": "Yeah, he was actually pretty interesting.

Star Wars, space opera film series (created by George Lucas) that became one of the most successful and influential franchises in motion picture history. Begun in the 1970s and ’80s and resuscitated at the turn of the 21st century, the Star Wars films continually advanced the field of motion picture special effects and developed into an enormously lucrative merchandising industry.

The film won six Academy Awards along with a special-achievement award for accomplishments in sound, and it revolutionized the motion picture industry with its advancements in special effects. Lucas’s effects company, Industrial Light and Magic (ILM), designed a slew of imaginative alien creatures and mechanical “droids” that populated a variety of exotic locales. Perhaps most impressive, however, were the elaborate space battles accomplished with scaled miniatures. The series continued to make remarkable advancements in the field of special effects into the 21st century, and ILM became one of the most successful effects studios utilized by Hollywood. Lucas followed the first Star Wars film with two sequels, Star Wars: Episode V—The Empire Strikes Back (1980) and Star Wars: Episode VI—Return of the Jedi (1983). The franchise thrived in the 1980s and ’90s through the release of videos, a substantial merchandise line, and the theatrical re-release of the trilogy in 1997. A seventh film, Star Wars: Episode VII—The Force Awakens, was released in 2015. It was the first entry in the series to be produced by the Walt Disney Company, which had purchased Lucasfilms Ltd. in 2012. The film, which was directed by J.J. Abrams, introduced new characters to the Star Wars mythos and expounded upon the stories of favourites such as Han Solo and Princess Leia. Star Wars: Episode VIII—The Last Jedi (2017), directed by Rian Johnson, carried on the saga with the reintroduction of Luke Skywalker. Rogue One (2016) and Solo (2018) were installments in A Star Wars Story series, which comprised stand-alone films.

{"Context": "My favorite actor is Robert Downey Jr. He is my favorite actor and I like very much", "Knowledge": "Hailed by many critics as one of the most brilliant and versatile actors of his generation, Robert Downey Jr. chalked up a formidable onscreen track record that quickly launched the young thesp into the stratosphere. Although, for a time, Downey s stormy offscreen life and personal problems threatened to challenge his public image, he quickly bounced back and overcame these setbacks, with a continued array of impressive roles on the big and small screens that never sacrificed his audience appeal or affability.The son of underground filmmaker Robert Downey, Downey Jr. was born in New York City on April 4, 1965. He made his first onscreen appearance at the age of five, as a puppy in his father s film Pound (1970). Between 1972 and 1990, he made cameo appearances in five more of his father s films. The actor s first significant role, in 1983 s Baby, It s You, largely ended up on the cutting-room floor; it wasn t until two years later that he began landing more substantial parts, first as a one-season cast member on Saturday Night Live and then in the comedy Weird Science. In 1987, he landed plum roles in two films that capitalized on the Brat Pack phenomenon, James Toback s The Pick-Up Artist, (opposite Molly Ringwald), and Less Than Zero, for which he won acclaim playing cocaine addict Julian Wells.Through it all, Downey cultivated an enviable instinct for role (and script) selection. His turns in Emile Ardolino s classy reincarnation fantasy Chances Are (1989), Michael Hoffman s Soapdish (1992), Robert Altman s Short Cuts (as the Iago-like Hollywood makeup artist Bill Bush), and Richard Loncraine s Richard III (1995) wowed viewers around the world, and often, on those rare occasions when Downey did choose substandard material, such as the lead in Richard Attenborough s deeply flawed Chaplin (1992), or an Australian media parasite in Oliver Stone s Natural Born Killers (1994), his performance redeemed it. In fact, critics deemed Downey s portrayal as one of the only worthwhile elements in the Chaplin biopic, and it earned the thesp a Best Actor Oscar nomination, as well as Golden Globe and British Academy Award noms.Around this time, Downey s personal life took a turn for the worse. In June 1996, the LAPD arrested the actor (who had already spent time in three rehabilitation facilities between 1987 and 1996) on counts including drug use, driving under the influence, possession of a concealed weapon, and possession of illegal substances, a development which struck many as ironic, given his star-making performance years prior in Less than Zero. A month after this arrest, police found Downey Jr. unconscious on a neighbor s lawn, under the influence of a controlled substance, and authorities again incarcerated him, taking him -- this time -- to a rehab center. A third arrest soon followed, as did another stint in rehab. His stay in rehab didn t last long, as he walked out, thereby violating the conditions of his bail. More arrests and complications followed -- in fact, the actor had to be released from rehab to make James Toback s Two Girls and a Guy -- but he still landed a few screen appearances and won praise for his work in Mike Figgis  One Night Stand (1997) and Altman s otherwise-disappointing Gingerbread Man (1998). In addition, he starred in one of his father s films, the offbeat Hugo Pool (1997). In 1999, he had three films out in theaters: Friends and Lovers, Bowfinger, and In Dreams. He delivered a particularly chilling performance in the latter, as longhaired psychopathic child murderer Vivian Thompson, that arguably ranked with his finest work. But Downey s problems caught up with him again that same year, when he was re-arrested and sentenced to 12 months in a state penitentiary. These complications led to the actor s removal from the cast of the summer 2001 Julia Roberts/Billy Crystal comedy America s Sweethearts and his removal from a stage production of longtime friend Mel Gibson s Hamlet, although a memorably manic", "Response": "Robert Downey Jr is, for sure, on of the most talented and versatile actors around.

EOS I have steamed, cooked lobster with noodle, fried it with peanut and garlic and cheese. I also know the recipe to cook lobster with sweet tamarin sauce. EOS Steaming sounds good. Maybe I'll check Food Network for a recipe. EOS yeah, steaming is still the best because it retains the sweetness of the lobster. I often eat steamed lobster with hot sauce. Sometimes I makes my own sauce with salt, pepper, and lemon to eat with steamed lobster. EOS That's great. No butter? EOS No butter in the sauce for me because it is a little bit too fat, but yeah it is optional, butter is a good choise too.", "Knowledge": "How to Grill Fish on a Stove", "Response": "How about the fish?

The seemingly endless landscape of white fences, paddocks, tobacco fields, and pastures in the rolling Bluegrass region around Lexington suggests an unhurried and genteel way of life that is more reminiscent of Kentucky’s ties with the antebellum South than it is reflective of the state’s position in the fast-paced economy of an industrialized country. By contrast, northernmost Kentucky, with its predominantly German heritage, its suburban pattern of development, and its orientation toward metropolitan Cincinnati, Ohio, is a reminder of the state’s link to the urban North. Kentucky has always existed in the middle: as a state looking back and ahead, as a crossroads for westward expansion, and as a territory with divided allegiance during the American Civil War (1861–65). Indeed, the Civil War presidents Abraham Lincoln of the Union and Jefferson Davis of the opposing Confederacy both were born in Kentucky. Area 40,408 square miles (104,656 square km).

His signature appears most legibly on films like Mean Streets, Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, and GoodFellas, all powerful inquiries into the nature and meaning of violence. After his inflated excursions into American history and celebrity biography in Gangs of New York and The Aviator, he returns to some characteristic locations and familiar people in his new movie about cops and crooks, The Departed. Employing a number of sequences of rapid montage, frequent changes of chronology, flashbacks within flashbacks, and a kind of visual dialectic based on crosscutting, The Departed suggests in its method the moral complexity of its subjects. Its two major characters, Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon) and Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio), both products of the tough Irish neighborhoods of South Boston, follow parallel tracks that occasionally intersect with a brutal violence. A detective sergeant in the Massachusetts State Police, Sullivan commands a special unit investigating the boss of the Irish mafia, Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson), while Costigan works in Costello s crew of thieves, thugs, and killers.", "Response": "The Departed is a movie with a lot of moral complexity.

I Love You / I Know Cookies George Lucas: Star Wars The success of American Graffiti enabled Lucas to finance a project that had been dear to his heart for some time. Science fiction had traditionally been a poor box-office performer, with such rare exceptions as Planet of the Apes (1968) and 2001: A… Lucas’s success as a writer and director with American Graffiti (1973) gained him the backing of 20th Century Fox, which put up $9.5 million for the production of the first Star Wars film. The film, directed by Lucas, was in production for four years, with scenes shot in Tunisia and Death Valley, California, and on soundstages in England. When it was released on May 25, 1977, Star Wars (later retitled Star Wars: Episode IV—A New Hope) met with runaway success. A space opera set “a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away,” the film centres on Luke Skywalker (played by the then relatively unknown Mark Hamill), a young man who finds himself embroiled in an interplanetary war between an authoritarian empire and rebel forces. Skywalker and the opportunistic smuggler Han Solo (Harrison Ford) are tasked with saving Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) from captivity on a massive space station commanded by the menacing Darth Vader, whose deep mechanically augmented voice (contributed by James Earl Jones) became instantly iconic. At the core of the film and the series it initiated are the Jedi Knights—a group of either benevolent or malevolent warriors who harness and manipulate the Force, an all-pervasive spiritual essence that holds in balance the forces of good and evil—and Skywalker’s quest to join their ranks. Star WarsGeorge Lucas (right) and Alec Guinness during the filming of Star Wars (1977). © 1977 Lucasfilm with Twentieth Century-Fox Film Corporation More than 20 years after the first film appeared, Lucas began releasing a second trilogy of films depicting events that had transpired before those in the original series. Lucas returned to the role of director (he had directed the first film but not its two sequels) and utilized a new cast of popular young actors—including Ewan McGregor and Natalie Portman—as well as recent advancements in digital video technology. Star Wars: Episode I—The Phantom Menace (1999), Star Wars: Episode II—Attack of the Clones (2002), and Star Wars: Episode III—Revenge of the Sith (2005) were all box-office successes, though they received markedly less critical acclaim than the original trilogy. The Star Wars franchise, however, remained incredibly lucrative into the 21st century. It included not only clothing, action figures, and multiple extensive book series but also the animated feature film Star Wars: The Clone Wars (2008)—which depicted events occurring between Episode II and Episode III—and numerous successful video game lines created by another of Lucas’s companies, LucasArts. By the time the sixth film was released in 2005, nearly 30 years after the series began, it was estimated that the franchise as a whole had brought in some $20 billion, an achievement thus far unparalleled in the motion picture industry.

Doctors warn that it s becoming a greater problem in Western countries as more people eat sushi, and they documented one recent case that serves as a cautionary tale. Newlyweds infected with rare parasitic disease When doctors questioned him about his symptoms and history, he revealed that he had recently eaten sushi. Doctors performed an endoscopy – a scope test that uses a tiny camera on the end of a long, flexible tube to view the upper digestive system – and discovered he had parasite larvae attached to the lining of his stomach wall. Most cases of the parasite have previously occurred in Japan, but the disease has been increasingly recognized as a problem in the West, the authors wrote. Patients can have other symptoms too, including nausea, digestive bleeding, bowel obstruction, inflammation of the abdomen and allergic symptoms including itching and anaphalaxis, a severe and life-threatening reaction, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Dr. Daniel Eiras, assistant professor of infectious diseases at NYU Langone Medical Center, told CBS News that it s pretty rare to see cases in the U.S. He s only seen one case about two years ago, in a 45-year-old man. The same goes for eating ceviche -- a dish made from raw fish and cured in lemon or lime juice -- and poke, a Hawaiian raw fish salad that s increasingly popping up on menus. When preparing fish at home, cook seafood to an internal temperature of 145 degrees Fahrenheit, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration recommends. The FDA says freezing fish can kill parasites, too.

Carrots and cucumber work well, and consider artificial cooked crab. Also, buy some dried seaweed (also known as nori) and uncooked rice. Pour the mixture onto the rice. Mix thoroughly by  slicing  the rice. Add rice wine vinegar, if needed, to make the grains of rice separate easily. Place the seaweed layer on a bamboo mat. Next, spread rice onto the seaweed. It should be spread out so there are no empty holes and it should fill the middle third. Dampen the end edge with rice vinegar, so that it sticks when you roll it. Place the strips of the veggies and the crab onto rice. What can I do if I don t have seaweed? SpaceFace29 You can make the fish into wider rectangular shapes, then place them on top of a ball of sushi rice. You can form these balls by wetting your hands and shaping the rice into small balls. This is nigiri sushi. Can I use rice noodles instead of rice? No, you need to use sushi rice. Using rice noodles will cause the sushi to fall apart. How many milliliters of rice wine vinegar should I use for 6 shushi rolls? Prepare Fish for Sushi Besides, sushi masters are passionate and possess a lot of sharp knives: better to stay on their good side. That being said, never distract the chef later with questions or small talk pertaining to the food, weather, or Japanese customs. The man is an artist, and he wields a sharp knife—let him work! If the meal turns out to be an unforgettable experience, you can even offer to buy the chef a shot of sake. If he accepts, you should have one with him. Never attempt to hand money—even a tip—to the chef; they work with raw fish all day and should never touch money. Besides, tipping is rare in Japanese custom and needs to be done carefully. Sushi (すし, 寿司, 鮨, pronounced [sɯ̥ɕiꜜ] or [sɯ̥ꜜɕi]) is a Japanese dish of prepared vinegared rice (鮨飯, sushi-meshi), usually with some sugar and salt, accompanying a variety of ingredients (ネタ, neta), such as seafood, vegetables, and occasionally tropical fruits. Styles of sushi and its presentation vary widely, but the one key ingredient is  sushi rice , also referred to as shari (しゃり), or sumeshi (酢飯).[1] 2.4 Modern Narezushi 3.2 American-style makizushi 7 Sustainable sushi Main article: History of sushi It was not until the Edo period (1603–1868) that fresh fish was served over vinegared rice and nori. The particular style of today s nigirizushi became popular in Edo (contemporary Tokyo) in the 1820s or 1830s. One common story of nigirizushi s origins is of the chef Hanaya Yohei (1799–1858), who invented or perfected the technique in 1824 at his shop in Ryōgoku.[6] The dish was originally termed Edomae zushi as it used freshly caught fish from the Edo-mae (Edo or Tokyo Bay); the term Edomae nigirizushi is still used today as a by-word for quality sushi, regardless of its ingredients  origins.[7][8] The earliest written mention of sushi in English described in the Oxford English Dictionary is in an 1893 book, A Japanese Interior, where it mentions sushi as  a roll of cold rice with fish, sea-weed, or some other flavoring .[9][10] There is an earlier mention of sushi in James Hepburn s Japanese-English dictionary from 1873,[11] and an 1879 article on Japanese cookery in the journal Notes and Queries.[12] Gomokuzushi (Kansai-style sushi) consists of cooked or uncooked ingredients mixed in the body of rice. Norway roll (ノルウェー巻き). A Norwegian businessman introduced the use of salmon as a sushi ingredient to Japan in the 1980s.[34] The increasing popularity of sushi around the world has resulted in variations typically found in the Western world, but rarely in Japan. A notable exception to this is the use of salmon, which was introduced by a Norwegian businessman tasked with helping the Norwegian salmon industry in the 1980s.[35][36][34] Such creations to suit the Western palate were initially fueled by the invention of the California roll (a norimaki with crab (later, imitation crab), cucumber, and avocado). A wide variety of popular rolls (norimaki and uramaki) has evolved since. Norway roll is another variant of uramakizushi filled with tamago (omelette), imitation crab and cucumber, rolled with shiso leaf and nori, topped with slices of Norwegian salmon, garnished with lemon and mayonnaise.[37] ^ a b Ōmae, Kinjirō; Tachibana, Yuzuru (1988).

That film — which revealed that the cookie-cutter uniformity of all those MCU movies had been part of an unprecedented master plan — infamously wrapped with a snap: a gesture that, when performed by a supervillain armed with the six Infinity Stones, was capable of wiping out half of all life in the universe. Audiences have had a year to mourn the loss of Spider-Man, Star-Lord, and Black Panther (whom they’d only just met two months earlier), and to nurture theories as to where directing siblings Anthony and Joe Russo might steer things from here. Maybe all those characters weren’t really dead. Maybe the remaining Avengers just needed to travel inside the Soul Stone to get them back. Or maybe “Avengers: Endgame” would have to resort to that most desperate of narrative cheats — time travel — to undo the damage caused by Thanos (the purple-skinned, multi-chinned baddie so compellingly performed by Josh Brolin). The element of surprise and the thrill of discovery are everything in these movies, so every attempt has been made to minimize spoilers. Yes, “Avengers: Endgame” is the most expansive film yet, and yes, it strives to provide emotional catharsis for several of fans’ favorite characters. It’s even safe to say that “Endgame” shifts the focus from extravagant, effects-driven displays of universe-saving — manifold though they remain — to the more human cost of heroism, which comes at great personal sacrifice. That said, readers should also be warned that “Avengers: Endgame” hinges on the most frustrating of narrative tricks, and that no meaningful analysis of the film can take place without delving into some of the choices made by the Russo brothers and screenwriters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely. If “Infinity War” was billed as a must-see event for all moviegoers, whether or not they’d attended a single Marvel movie prior, then “Endgame” is the ultimate fan-service follow-up, so densely packed with pay-offs to relationships established in the previous films that it all but demands that audiences put in the homework of watching (or rewatching) a dozen earlier movies to appreciate the sense of closure it offers the series’ most popular characters.", "Response": "Endgame gave a much-needed closure to the Infinity Wars, and combined elements of all previous films."}

You can use it to play music from sources such as Amazon Music or Spotify; you can ask her about the weather, get updates on the news, or a heads-up on your schedule; you can also use her to set timers or alarms. And with the addition of third-party apps called “skills,” you can broaden her capabilities further, so you can order Domino’s pizza or an Uber, or play a trivia game. Because of its small size and cheap price point—full price, it’s $50, but it’s often on sale for less—the device is often used in homes that already have one or more larger Alexa-enabled devices so that you can access Alexa anywhere in your home. You can also use the device as an intercom. Once your Echo Dot is all set up, you can summon its smarts by saying “Alexa,” followed by a query. There are a huge number of things you can ask or command of Alexa (and if you don’t like “Alexa” as the device’s wake word, you can switch that to “Amazon,” “Echo,” or “Computer” in the app—especially useful if someone in your house is named something similar to “Alexa”). You can start off your day by asking Alexa what the weather is, or for your daily news briefing. You can also ask her to play music from a number of different sources. She can do a number of smartphone-type tasks, things such as setting an alarm or timer, acting as a reference when you have a question, or letting you make calls or send messages to contacts.", "Response": "Right!?

They ventured a heavier, bluesier sound than their British Invasion counterparts, taking their cues from Muddy Waters and Howlin  Wolf. The band s greatest strength, besides Charlie Watts, has always been their ability to add stylistic touches drawn from their interests in Eastern music, psychedelia, country and even disco to a blues rock chassis. It s difficult to listen to the trippy Their Satanic Majesties Request, the down-and-out honky-tonk of Exile On Main Street and the clean modernist surfaces of Bridges To Babylon and believe they were recorded by the same band. Of course, in some ways they weren t; the lineup changes that have dogged the Stones account for much of their musical diversity. Jagger s famous slur and Richards  sloppy guitar elegance are the two constants in the band s many life cycles that make every Stones song instantly recognizable.", "Response": "I'd start with The Stones first album, 1964"}

Glistening white plateaus, dark crevices, and slimy surfaces boast steamy temperatures of 95 degrees Fahrenheit. The microbes bathe in a saliva-induced humidity of 100 percent, and eat a lavish diet of sugar and other carbohydrates. It’s so lush and varied, researcher Donna Mager refers to it as a mini-jungle. Mager is a fellow in oral medicine at the Forsyth Institute, an independent research institution in Boston. Forsyth scientists, most of whom are on the faculty of the Harvard School of Dental Medicine, have found 615 different species of bacteria – and they’re still counting. “In one mouth, the number of bacteria can easily exceed the number of people who live on Earth,” notes Sigmund Socransky, associate clinical professor of periodontology at Harvard. Years of detecting and identifying mouth tenants have revealed that those living in healthy mouths can be remarkably different from those living in diseased mouths. Some bacteria increase in number, while others decrease. By comparing communities of microbes in healthy people with those in the mouths of those with oral cancer, Mager has found a pattern that she expects will lead to the early diagnosis of oral cancers.", "Response": "Microbiolgy would be really important in dentistry, I would imagine.

Holmes claims that Jimmy Page stole his licks and lyrics for “Dazed and Confused,” perhaps the greatest tune on the Zep’s first album. Holmes says his version of the song was written in 1967, two years before Led Zeppelin’s. Jimmy Page, along with the rest of the Yardbirds, performed on the same bill as Holmes when he played in Greenwich Village in August 1967. Perhaps that’s when Page became familiar with the number. Page also said that Robert Plant, the Zep’s primary songwriter, had gotten them into trouble by directly taking lyrics from artists such as Willie Dixon, who sued the Zep for making “Whole Lotta Love.” Found on Led Zeppelin II, the song certainly brings to mind Dixon’s “You Need Love.”", "Response": "For what it is worth, they were sued by other artists as well.

Released 29 April 2019. Featuring a beautiful gatefold sleeve (350gsm), pressed on 180 gsm heavy vinyl, complete with black poly-lined inner. AUTUMN was an entirely instrumental, highly progressive British band based in Portsmouth during the years 1976 to 1978 and writing and recording music with elaborate symphonic soundscapes and a powerful rock undertow. Music with touches of Genesis/Gentle Giant/Yes/The Enid amongst others yet creating an individual sound of their own. Although never to commercially succeed due, in part, to the rise of Punk, the band received critical acclaim and respect. Now 4 decades later a vinyl version of the original unreleased album is available for the first time. ‘Oceanworld’ is a truly progressive work of its time of which the band are rightfully proud. The unreleased album ‘Oceanworld’ (originally recorded in 1977/78) was released for the first time ever on February 15th 1999 on CD. The tracks were re-mastered to a high degree but no additional recordings or overdubs were added. The CD sold well but went out of stock in 2002. Now in 2019, because of the recent resurgence in vinyl appreciation there is now some demand for a vinyl release of ‘Oceanwordl’. “We had a great time writing and playing this music (over 40 years ago!) and we hope the scale of the sound we produced will still be fully appreciated today”. Two of Autumn’s members came from The Enid (Nick Magnus and Robbie Dobson) and one member (Nick) was to join The Steve Hackett Band for many world tours and recordings.

After all, the group s first live release, If You Want Blood You ve Got It, was recorded at a time when AC/DC was nothing more than a cult act that had yet to produce many of its future rock staples. Though recorded well into their career on the Razor s Edge 1991 tour, AC/DC Live surprisingly captures the hype and excitement that made AC/DC such a hit in their heyday. The set list wisely overlooks the songs from the band s mid- 80s slump and concentrates on hard rock hits such as  Hells Bells,   Back in Black,   Highway to Hell,  and  Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap.  Brian Johnson s voice may not be as strong as in the early  80s, but he still sounds competent in his role. All too often, a live album is a cheaply made, rushed recording that only serves as a testament to a band s decline. AC/DC Live, however, shows what makes this band different from their peers -- here they are still entirely capable of pulling off a great live show. This ranks among the best live metal albums of the  90s. [In February 2003, the American distribution rights to AC/DC s back catalog transferred over to Epic, their new label. Epic reissued the band s catalog as remastered digipacks containing lavish, expanded booklets with plenty of rare photographs, memorabilia, and notes. Although the digipacks may wear a little too easy, the sound is terrific -- clean and muscular, enhancing the raw qualities of the original record -- and the packaging is loving, making the reissues necessary for collectors.]", "Response": "Oh wow!

Reactive nitrogen is a required constituent of soil used for plant growth, and it is possible that nitrogen fixing species, such as bacteria, could aide in the lack of reactive nitrogen series. However, a 2014 study suggested that plants were able to germinate and survive a period of 50 days on a Martian and lunar soil by using simulant soils.

You d definitely be weightless. You d possibly be spinning. In space, no kicking and flailing can change your fate. And your fate could be horrible. At the right angle and velocity, you might even fall back into Earth s atmosphere and burn up. That s why NASA has protocols that it drills into astronauts for such situations. You would be wearing your emergency jetpack, called SAFER, which would automatically counter any tumbling to stabilize you. Then NASA s plan dictates that you take manual control and fly back to safety.", "Response": "Yes they would.

Thanks for sharing your description! ~ Annemarie Wit Yi Kyaw PUBLISHED Jan. 16, 2019, at 9:00 AM Compare your results to those of your friends and family. First, the Big Five doesn’t put people into neat personality “types,” because that’s not how personalities really work. Instead, the quiz gives you a score on five different traits: extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, negative emotionality and openness to experience. For each of those traits, you’re graded on a scale from 0 to 100, depending on how strongly you associate with that trait. So, for example, this quiz won’t tell you whether you’re an extravert or an introvert — instead, it tells you your propensity toward extraversion. Every trait is graded on a spectrum, with a few people far out on the extremes and a lot of people in the middle. The other thing that makes the Big Five different is it lets you easily compare your score to others’. We’re going to show you how your personality compares with that of the average American. And once you get your results, you can invite friends and relatives to compare your personality to theirs. (In the meantime, you’ll be stuck comparing yourself to the average FiveThirtyEight staffer.)

Sign Compatibility for Virgo Love Matches When you see an old couple holding hands or sharing romantic kisses while sitting on a park bench, doesn t that spark warm feelings of love and happiness in your heart? Doesn t it make you think about how they maintained their relationship for so many years when couples you know have trouble making it past six months? And of course, some people are not made for each other and so their relationship just simply doesn t work. But then there are couples who give up the minute an obstacle comes along, which makes you think their relationship wasn t truly important to them in the first place. What everyone has to understand in order to preserve a strong, happy, and prosperous relationship is that love is colorful, and the same kind of love doesn t exist for everyone. Being in a loving relationship that continues to thrive, I m going to share some of the few things that I believe should exist between two lovers who want to sustain their prosperous relationship. Communicating with your partner is essential. I m sure you ve heard it before, but communication is key. If something is bothering you or what your partner wants to do isn t what you re interested in, say something! Neither you nor your partner are mind readers, so how are they supposed to know how you feel if you keep your feelings bottled up inside? Not speaking up and communicating your ideas, feelings, desires, and wants is unhealthy because one day you might blow up and say some things you ll either regret or feel sorry for saying. Communicate to find a middle ground in your relationship because it s unfair for one person to constantly accommodate the other. Relationships cannot grow without communication, so don t be afraid to speak your mind and embrace your thoughts. The small things in life are actually not that small. There are times where the smallest deed can make someone the happiest and that s usually because the small things are the most thoughtful ones. Preparing breakfast when your partner is too tired or surprising them with an iced caramel latte on their way home from work can be enough to make their day. The small things really do count and they are remembered more than you might think. There s something magical in knowing that your partner feels appreciated and happy that they have the privilege of calling you mine. And the small things can do just that.

{"Context": "I live in San Jose, California. My family and i go camping every month. My favorite part is making smores. EOS Your chat partner has the following personality and interests. EOS I look forward to eating by the campfire when I camp.", "Knowledge": "How to Effectively Approach Your Partner About Relationship Issues As the talking partner, or initiator, you have several options in addressing issues. One is to attack your partner with a list of complaints in a way that shows you don’t believe that anything will change. If this is your choice, your partner is most likely going to defend him/herself by returning fire with a similar list of complaints or shutting down emotionally to avoid further critique and escalating conflict. As you probably have experienced, attacking your partner is not conductive to the two of you achieving a real understanding of each other’s differences. When couples run into a pattern of attacking and/or avoiding behavior, they are reacting emotionally to each other’s complaints and critiques. Partners often have mixed feelings of anger and hurt. Furthermore, they most likely feel disrespected and mistreated by the other partner while they behave disrespectfully in turn. In this kind of vicious cycle, there is little goodwill, understanding of each other’s thoughts and feelings, or willingness to discuss different perspectives or points of view. What is the message that you want your partner to hear? What do you want your partner to understand about you? How do you want your partner to feel after the conversation? Do you want your partner to feel closer to you and hopeful about your future together? Or do you want your partner to feel guilty, shameful, and/or angry or hurt? I have a new man in my life and I’m finding little things I’d like to talk about with him before it gets bad. One is he doesn’t want to be in pics with me cuz I’m on social media. I wasn’t even going to post it and he jumped to conclusions. How do I talk to him? He says it’s just not my thing. And me I’m all about memories and I love taking pics not even selfies. I am a terrible communicator. Over the years it’s just become worse. I have major anxiety and freeze up during anything, so a major conversation about problems that need to save my relationship cause me to blank out. All I can do is try my best. :( I get really angry and say things I regret. I know now what I’m doing wrong and I’ve always been this way. I just want to be the best person that I can. I’m tired of fighting. I’ve been with my partner for a little under 2 years. We moved in together about a month ago. We have 3 kids between us. It’s a love match and he treats me very well. Takes lots of care with the relationship and makes an effort on a daily basis. We rarely argue, have similar values and overall have a very harmonious life together. I am struggling to trust him however. I am concerned though as he has a history of withholding information from me when we first were together. It took him 4 months (and, in the end, a direct line of questioning from me) to learn that he had some addictions and (linked to the addiction) infidelities in the relatively recent past (within the past 5 years). When I pressed him on why he had hidden this from me he said he was worried I would not want to be with him and also that his partner before me had told him to not tell anyone new for the same reasons. Since then he has been open on these things. He has also done intensive therapy. His ex refers to him as the ‘new and improved version’. His previous partner was very unhappy about him moving on from her and for the first 6 months or so pushed him for ‘family days’ out with their 2 kids and bombarded with texts, phone calls etc, some of which he told me about and some of which he didn’t (worried about my reaction as I said from the outset that I was unhappy at how ’emeshed’ their relationship was since they broke up). I also found out at a recent family event that some of the timelines he gave me around their breakup and his move out did not align with what he had told me (6 -8 months later than what he told me). Everything else around the circumstances did match up. I haven’t asked him about this differing timeline as it all happened before he met me, but I don’t understand why someone would lie about this. Since then, he has made strong moves to put clearer boundaries around things and this seems to have worked. In recent months however, I have noticed what I think are overly familiar sign offs on texts (kisses, kiss emojis, hugs) some of which I think are to her. Sometimes he texts in my line of sight which is why I have seen them. Or might be to someone else….unsure. Have checked discreetly via questions and ascertained not his kids or mother. Also, getting texts with what I think are these emojis and then “having to make a work call” but stepping outside when a “work call” could easily be taken then and there. I have never gone through his phone or emails and I don’t actually want to as I feel very uncomfortable with this. I don’t think that approach would build trust and it would potentially damage our relationship longer term. He has said his previous partner would openly read emails and messages if he left his devices around (even after they broke up) and I don’t think he appreciated this. I am trying very hard to be trusting but failing. If it is his ex partner I don’t feel comfortable with this familiarity on texts or similar and if not his ex partner then wondering…who the hell!? Not sure how to broach this with him….any advice? The phone call finishes. Of course, all business telephone conversations do not follow this rigid scheme. However, this is the basic outline for most business telephone conversations, especially those made to businesses to request information or ask for clarification.

Doug Stone, co-author of Difficult Conversations: How to Discuss What Matters Most, says that in order to deal effectively with awkward, tense, or challenging conversations, we first need to understand the common mistakes we make — and then take 5 steps for tackling tough conversations. Working at the Harvard Negotiation Project with thousands of people, Stone and his colleagues found that we often make 3 major errors in our conversations: We assume we know all we need to know to understand and explain a situation. A classroom that’s alive with debate is one of the most enjoyable places to learn. It’s also the perfect environment for promoting students’ understanding: children are much better equipped to write their ideas down once they have discussed them. Talking helps students to gather their thoughts, process information and remember it. But there’s an art to holding a successful student discussion. Unless you want your classroom to descend into mayhem, you’ll need to think carefully about how to structure your debate, pose effective questions and keep students on track. Here are some ideas for getting started. At the beginning of the lesson, ask a question that provokes discussion but isn’t heading towards a single, correct answer. For example, what is the one thing you’d most like to change about the world? How would you describe an elephant? Who is the most important scientist in the world? Every second, 28,258 Internet users are watching porn and spending more than $3,000 on it. Per second. Surveys of college-age men show that 93 percent have been exposed to porn before the age of 18. Another study found that about half of young adult women agree that viewing pornography is acceptable, and a survey conducted tells us that as many as 1 out of 3 women watch porn at least once a week. So if you’re thinking that porn hasn’t touched your relationship or your partner hasn’t seen anything, the statistics suggest otherwise. It’s a pretty solid bet that your partner casually views or has viewed pornography at some point. That doesn’t make them a bad person/partner, but it definitely means you need to have a conversation. Porn can be more harmful than you might expect", "Response": "Your role in this conversation is to assist your partner in learning and discussing"}

Rex died in a heated cross-country rally known as The Crucible many years ago, and now his younger sibling is driven to fulfill the legacy that Rex left behind. To this day, Speed Racer is fiercely loyal to family. It was Speed Racer s father, Pops Racer (John Goodman), who designed the unbeatable Mach 5, and even a lucrative offer from racing giants Royalton Industries isn t enough to get the young ace to break his family ties. Upon turning down Royalton s (Roger Allam) astronomical offer, Speed Racer makes the shocking discovery that the outcomes of the biggest races are being predetermined by a handful of powerful moguls who pad their profits by manipulating the drivers. Realizing that his career would be ruined if word of the fix gets out, Royalton vows that the Mach 5 will never make it to another finish line. Now, the only way for Speed Racer to save the family business and beat Royalton at his own game will be to win the very same race that claimed his brother s life so many years ago.

Do you care whether your chips have artificial or natural flavors? EOS I do not care. I just think they are delicious!  Are those banned flavors dangerous? EOS Some of them were found to cause cancer in lab animals. Do you like regular chips, kettle cooked, or chips in a can best? EOS I just eat regular chips. Great Value.  They are cheap and JUST as good. EOS Consumer Reports found that many Great Value brand products, like almonds and mayonnaise, were as good as name brand products. It sounds like the potato chips are also good value. Are there other Great Value products that you love, or just the chips? EOS I love most of their products. It's what I usually buy!  Even their steak sauce!", "Knowledge": "There is nothing like the flavor and aroma of a perfectly done steak. Steak is a complete sensory experience, starting with the beautiful grain of the meat, the colors (red, pink, grey, or any combination, depending on how you like your steak cooked), the sound of the steak sizzling on the grill, the aroma of excellent cooked beef, and the exquisite sweetish, slightly musky taste. And steak is a very personal issue for many. Some people are very picky about how they will accept their steak. Some, like myself, prefer it rare, with buttered mushrooms on top. Others prefer it well-done, perhaps with grilled onions, and/or green peppers. Some will argue that a really good steak requires nothing but a knife, fork and an appetite.", "Response": "Steak sauce is delicious on grilled steak. Do you eat your steak with vegetables like onions or mushrooms, or are you happy to have your steak with your Great Value chips?"}

Science fiction had traditionally been a poor box-office performer, with such rare exceptions as Planet of the Apes (1968) and 2001: A… Lucas’s success as a writer and director with American Graffiti (1973) gained him the backing of 20th Century Fox, which put up $9.5 million for the production of the first Star Wars film. The film, directed by Lucas, was in production for four years, with scenes shot in Tunisia and Death Valley, California, and on soundstages in England. When it was released on May 25, 1977, Star Wars (later retitled Star Wars: Episode IV—A New Hope) met with runaway success. A space opera set “a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away,” the film centres on Luke Skywalker (played by the then relatively unknown Mark Hamill), a young man who finds himself embroiled in an interplanetary war between an authoritarian empire and rebel forces. Skywalker and the opportunistic smuggler Han Solo (Harrison Ford) are tasked with saving Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) from captivity on a massive space station commanded by the menacing Darth Vader, whose deep mechanically augmented voice (contributed by James Earl Jones) became instantly iconic. At the core of the film and the series it initiated are the Jedi Knights—a group of either benevolent or malevolent warriors who harness and manipulate the Force, an all-pervasive spiritual essence that holds in balance the forces of good and evil—and Skywalker’s quest to join their ranks. Though Star Wars initially opened in only 42 theatres, the film earned almost $3 million in its first week and had grossed $100 million by the end of the summer. The film won six Academy Awards along with a special-achievement award for accomplishments in sound, and it revolutionized the motion picture industry with its advancements in special effects. Lucas’s effects company, Industrial Light and Magic (ILM), designed a slew of imaginative alien creatures and mechanical “droids” that populated a variety of exotic locales. Perhaps most impressive, however, were the elaborate space battles accomplished with scaled miniatures. The series continued to make remarkable advancements in the field of special effects into the 21st century, and ILM became one of the most successful effects studios utilized by Hollywood. Lucas followed the first Star Wars film with two sequels, Star Wars: Episode V—The Empire Strikes Back (1980) and Star Wars: Episode VI—Return of the Jedi (1983). The franchise thrived in the 1980s and ’90s through the release of videos, a substantial merchandise line, and the theatrical re-release of the trilogy in 1997. Star Wars: Episode V—The Empire Strikes BackMark Hamill, as Luke Skywalker, and Yoda in Star Wars: Episode V—The Empire Strikes Back (1980), directed by Irvin Kershner. Twentieth Centuryx-Fox A seventh film, Star Wars: Episode VII—The Force Awakens, was released in 2015. It was the first entry in the series to be produced by the Walt Disney Company, which had purchased Lucasfilms Ltd. in 2012. The film, which was directed by J.J. Abrams, introduced new characters to the Star Wars mythos and expounded upon the stories of favourites such as Han Solo and Princess Leia. Star Wars: Episode VIII—The Last Jedi (2017), directed by Rian Johnson, carried on the saga with the reintroduction of Luke Skywalker. Rogue One (2016) and Solo (2018) were installments in A Star Wars Story series, which comprised stand-alone films.

[that] binds the galaxy together. [11] Those whom  the Force is strong with  have quick reflexes; through training and meditation, they are able to perform various superpowers (such as telekinesis, precognition, telepathy, and manipulation of physical energy).[12] The Force is wielded by two major knighthood orders at conflict with each other: the Jedi, who act on the light side of the Force through non-attachment and arbitration, and the Sith, who use the dark side through fear and aggression. The latter s members are intended to be limited to two: a master and their apprentice.[13] With the backstory he created for the sequel, Lucas decided that the series would be a trilogy of trilogies,[31] Most of the main cast would return for the two additional installments of the original trilogy, which were self-financed by Lucasfilm. The original film was retitled Star Wars: Episode IV – A New Hope for a 1981 rerelease.[32] Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back was released in May 1980, also achieving wide financial and critical success. The final film in the trilogy, Episode VI: Return of the Jedi was released in May 1983. The story of the original trilogy focuses on Luke Skywalker s quest to become a Jedi, his struggle with the evil Imperial agent Darth Vader, and the struggle of the Rebel Alliance to free the galaxy from the clutches of the Empire. The sequel trilogy focuses on the journey of the orphaned scavenger Rey following in the footsteps of the Jedi with the guidance of the reluctant last Jedi, Luke Skywalker. Along with ex-stormtrooper Finn, she helps the Resistance led by Leia fight the First Order commanded by Supreme Leader Snoke and his pupil Kylo Ren (Han Solo and Leia s son). Episode VII: The Force Awakens was released on December 18, 2015, Episode VIII: The Last Jedi on December 15, 2017, and Episode IX is due to be released on December 20, 2019. Further information: List of Star Wars films and television series § Animated series 1 13 1985–86 N/A Nelvana ABC Between Revenge of the Sith and A New Hope Lucas decided to invest in creating his own animation company, Lucasfilm Animation, and used it to create his first in-house Star Wars CGI-animated series. The Clone Wars (2008–2014) was introduced through a 2008 animated film of the same name.[70] Both were accepted to the highest level canon in 2014; all series released afterwards would also be canon.[55][71] In 2014, Disney XD began airing Star Wars Rebels, the first CGI-animated series produced in the new era. Set between Revenge of the Sith and A New Hope, it follows a band of rebels as they fight the Galactic Empire and helped close some of the arcs in The Clone Wars.[72][73][74][75] The animated microseries Star Wars Forces of Destiny debuted in 2017, focusing on the female characters of the franchise.[76] The animated series Star Wars Resistance debuted in late 2018, is anime-inspired, and focuses on a young Resistance pilot shortly before The Force Awakens.[77] ^ Reagin, Nancy R.; Liedl, Janice (October 15, 2012).

The German art movement known as the Neue Sachlichkeit (New Objectivity), on the other hand, worked in a realist style to express the cynicism and disillusionment of the post-World War I period in Germany.

When he fell in Moria he continued to fight the Balrog and eventually overcame him. The ordeal changed him, and he has returned in white to signify that he is now the head of the wizard s council. Gandalf takes the three remaining members of the Fellowship to Edoras, Rohan s capital, to counter the evil influence of Saruman. King Théoden has listened to the evil counsels of Wormtongue, Saruman s spy, succumbing to old age and despair. Gandalf rouses him from his stupor and reveals Wormtongue s treachery.

Based on an estimate of consumers across the world laundering 100,000 Patagonia jackets each year, the amount of fibers being released into public waterways is equivalent to the amount of plastic in up to 11,900 grocery bags. To try to get ahead of the problem, Patagonia and other apparel companies have said they want to research new yarn and fabric constructions to determine whether microfiber shedding can be addressed through better design, something that’s already happening in Europe. After a 2013 European Commission–funded research program called Mermaids found that surfactants in detergents lead to much higher fiber loss—on the order of 1 million fibers shed from a single fleece jacket—textile specialists in Spain and Italy were tasked with developing a special coating or impregnation that would be applied to the fabric during manufacture and, in theory, reduce the amount of fiber loss. More details on the program are expected in December, but researchers say the coatings being tested and developed are environmentally benign.", "Response": "Fleece is really cozy, but it can be a big pollutant.

Roland Stickey, a New York inventor and designer, dreamed up the Sterling Streamliner diner model for the J.B. Judkins Company of Massachusetts. It looked so much like a train that “[only] the tracks and the passenger cars were missing,” writes roadside culture historian Michael Karl Witzel. With it convenient shape and cutting-edge look, similar designs soon were shipped across the country, a culmination of what Witzel calls the diner’s “strange alliance with trains.” Often, they were built in New Jersey: Today, the state has 600 diners in operation, and is still considered America’s diner capital.", "Response": "That's very interesting, especially since dining cars on trains are actually what inspired the modern diner.
